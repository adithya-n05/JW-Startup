# JW Startup
- This is some work to do with a startup being submitted to W24's YC batch under Jeff Wilson

### To Do:
- [] Scrape data online using google search results
- [] Clean up data and select additional prompts for scraping and searching
- [] Develop solution to bypass blockers and surpass limits placed by websites like NY Times
- [] Develop LLM based solution to auto scrape data for use in llama index (Perplexity esque clone for multiple searches)
- [] Develop initial prototype in llama index using ada embeddings model
- [] Switch to better embeddings model to improve quality of output
- [] Scrape data from video content on youtube and segment based on Jeff's voice and use data to create more authentic representations of his speaking style

### Later:
- [] Use knowledge graph based method of using RAG to pull data contextually related to Jeff Wilson
- [] Collect data on chats and logs to pull data 
- [] Switch to running on Groq for faster inference (using API)
- [] Store data on S3 instead of storing locally or on git repo due to large file sizes
- [] Use tortoise tts for voice clone of Jeff
