Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project.[4]\nJupe[edit]\nIn 2020, Wilson launched Jupe, a flat-packed housing tech startup.[5]\nKasita[edit]\nKasita Exterior\nWilson was a Co-Founder and CEO at the startup company Kasita.[6][2][7] Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies[14] and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award.[15] Wilson has referred to Kasita as a holistic integrated product, rather than a house.[16] In December 2018, Kasita was sold to a tiny house hotel company[17] in Austin, Texas.\nThe Dumpster Project[edit]\nProfessor Dumpster in front of a dumpster\nWilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)(3) non-profit 'The Dumpster Project',[18] a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home.[19] The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant[26] and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition,[27] but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal.[28] The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity.[29] On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'.[30] Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators.[31][32] On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster.[4][33] Wilson claims that the dumpster experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.[6]\n\"No Baggage\" experiment[edit]\nWilson and Bensen in No Baggage\nTogether with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' \"No Baggage\", in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website.[34][35][36] New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones [37] to screen write the film based on a book[38] from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen.[39][40][41][42] American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.[43]\n99 Nights Couchsurfing experiment[edit]\nSubsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces.[4][44] The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.[45]\nAcademic Work[edit]\nWilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston\u2013Tillotson University in Austin, Texas.[1] He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury[46] and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.[47] Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.[48]\nReferences[edit]\n^\na b Wilson, Jeff. \"Jeff Wilson, Huston Tillotson\".

(Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nAt Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas an environmental science professor teaches sustainability by example, transforming an empty dumpster into a tiny apartment where he\u2019s lived for a year. Professor Jeff Wilson tells host Steve Curwood about life in his micro home and his long-term goals for Project Dumpster.\n\n\nTranscript\nCURWOOD: Oscar the Grouch lives in a trash can. So did Popeye the Sailor Man, but it\u2019s hardly the kind of home you\u2019d expect for a college professor. Yet Dr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, is teaching sustainability by downsizing his living quarters to the dimensions of a dumpster \u2013 a clean dumpster, mind you. Jeff Wilson joins me now from his steel abode on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, where he\u2019s Dean of the University College and teaches environmental science. Welcome to Living on Earth, Jeff, or, do you prefer, \u201cProfessor Dumpster?\u201d\nWILSON: I\u2019ll take Professor Dumpster and you\u2019re at my disposal.\nCURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Right now you're in your dumpster. What kind of headroom do you have?\nWILSON: Well, it's a standard 10 cubic yard dumpster, which means it's six foot by six foot at the base. And this one's actually quite tall; it's about seven feet.\n\nProfessor Jeff Wilson makes the most of his 36 square-foot tiny house. (Photo: Sarah\nNatsumi Moore)\nCURWOOD: I have to say, it doesn't sound like you're in a metal box. What creature comforts are there with you in dampening the acoustics?\nWILSON: Right. We're actually in the second phase of this experiment turning it into an average studio apartment. First of all, I've got a wooden false floor, so the actual height of standing room is about 6'2\" right now. I've got a window unit air conditioner. I have a few tapestries hanging on the wall. I have a twin bed and then a very small bookshelf on the corner with various things like an Oscar the Grouch mug and a Dr. Who Tardis.\nCURWOOD: You moved into your dumpster about a year ago. How come?\nWILSON: So the main point of this entire experiment is to test if one can have a pretty good life on a whole lot less. This is obviously an outlier, an extreme example of that. I've moved into 36 square feet, which is 1 percent the size of the average new American home today, so that\u2019s the ultimate goal of this. A lot of people asked why we used a dumpster instead of a tiny house or instead of even a container, and the reason we did that were some of the awareness and educational aspects of this project around addressing waste. And dumpsters, you know, are these magical boxes that we put our waste into and come back a few days later after a little bit of noise in the middle of the night, which I'm very aware of at this point, [LAUGHS] that garbage truck noise, and everything's disappeared. So we want to highlight some of those subjects as well.\n\nDr. Dumpster plans to amp up his sustainability project this winter by adding amenities such as a second story, solar panels and a composting toilet. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: By the way, what risk do run from, you know, the odd garbage truck seeing the dumpster and figuring maybe it'll dump you?\nWILSON: There is a bit of confusion, especially since all the dumpsters are still labeled no entry for humans. We have a few safety features, so that I'm not serviced. We have welded shut the front pockets, they usually pick up dumpsters with. And there also happens to be a weather station on this dumpster, so even the new guy hopefully won't mistake this dumpster for a normal trash dumpster.\nCURWOOD: Now, I'm looking at a drawing from your website entitled, \"Early thoughts on proposed designs.\" Let's see, there's solar panels, a sleeping loft, air-conditioning and heating, a water collection system, even a folding balcony. To what extent have you actually transformed that 36 square feet of metal into home sweet home?\n\nProfessor Wilson stands with his girlfriend Clara Benson outside his dumpster. (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore)\nWILSON: What we're going to do in this phase is try to make this into an average American home using normal appliances. So we're going to get a fairly normal toilet, shower head; we'll probably expand out a few of the walls to give us a little bit more space to do this. The spec that you're looking at is actually the third phase, what we call the \"uber\" dumpster, and in his phase we're going to use all the baseline data that we collected using the normal sort of stuff. In this third phase we're going to utilize solar and lower-flow type equipment so that we can hopefully get to 1 percent the usage of energy and water, and 1 percent the creation of waste of an average American home.\nCURWOOD: So what about Mother Nature? I mean, particularly what do you have in the way of plumbing?\nWILSON: This is a particularly difficult issue to deal with. Not only is it not a lot of fun urinating into a bottle when it's an emergency, or running to the nearest building in the middle of the night; it's also a problem in terms of design: dealing with waste in a healthy-type way, and also one that doesn't give off much of a fragrance in such a small space, but also by coding regulation. In Austin, it's currently not legal to have a composting toilet. What we are probably going to have to do is, you know, attach something to the outside of the dumpster or expand one of the walls and just capture that blackwater like in an RV.\n\nEgress from the dumpster can be challenging. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: So, your home, Professor Wilson, the dumpster, that is, is about 1 percent of the size of the average American home, and during your experimental year you're going to try to use only 1 percent of the water and energy of the typical home and generate only 1 percent of the average waste. So far, how's it going?\nWILSON: Well, we did quite well in the first phase because we weren't plugged into water or electricity for the first six months. The only issue is that it wasn't exactly that comfortable. When I'm moved in February we had three, what they call at least in Texas \"snow days\" meaning that it got below about 35 degrees, and generally the temperature in that phase inside, was the temperature outside. What we hope to do, not only looking at newer technologies for using less water and energy and things like solar, but also thinking a little bit more carefully about what sort of activities we use water and energy for. Most people, sort of, when they move to a smaller house,or move to a tiny home, one of the things they notice is that they spend a lot more time outdoors and a lot more time in the community. And one of the things we're interested in is the increased interactions with the community and the environment when you're in a smaller home like this, sort of what that might do for one's sort of quality-of-life and sense of experience and just the overall magic that is brought into the everyday. If you want to call it dumpster magic.\n[LAUGHS]\n\nProfessor Wilson\u2019s students peek in through the dumpster\u2019s \u201cwindow\u201d. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: Well, you certainly sound like a friendly guy, and I'm sure that you have friends, lovers, perhaps. So what kinds of guests do you have at your dumpster?\nWILSON: [LAUGHS] Well, I'll start with the latter one. I did have a girlfriend at the beginning of the experiment, and it seems that she is still around at least in the last coupleof days. And a lot of people do ask if you know this is the type of experiment that attracts the ladies, and I'll say that's a definite no. I do have frequent guests here; I don't stay in the dumpster when I have these guests\u2014and these are generally students or couch surfers. I've had people from several continents couch-surf in the dumpster; we\u2019ve got a very special guest on Thursday, I actually have the CEO of \u201ccouch-surfing\u201d itself, dumpster-surfing.\nCURWOOD: And as for your girlfriend so far she hasn't dumped you.\nWILSON: So to speak and I refrain from calling her a trashy chick.\nCURWOOD: Ooooh.\nWILSON: [LAUGHS]\nCURWOOD: So your goal for dumpster dwelling goes beyond just spending a year in a small space, it's all about educating through this project dumpster. So what do you hope to accomplish?\nWILSON: In the short-term, we've really got sort of a Zen, in the moment thing going on. We're looking to reach out to the public and reach out to our students for ideas such as ideas on this toilet. It's one of the biggest problems. I mean, the idea of a toilet, the pure ridiculousness of it\u2014that you've got to have this big piece of porcelain; you've got to have a whole sewage system. You've got to have a couple gallons of fresh water. These are some of the things that I think we're able to attack in a very small way. I mean, ultimately what this experiment is all about is not just can you be happy on a lot less, but I like to think of the dumpster as a conversation box, and as long as a conversation continues to go on, whether it be about sustainability, climate change, tiny homes or whether it be\u2014as some have suggested Obama's new housing plan\u2014as long as that conversation's going on and people are talking about it, I think we'll have accomplished our goal.\nCURWOOD: Professor Jeff Wilson teaches Environmental Studies at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Great talking to you from your dumpster. I hope you'll bring it to Boston and invite us for dinner, or maybe even a sleepover.\nWILSON: Hey, Boston or Austin, mi dumpster es tu casa, so just let me know next time you\u2019re around and when we're in Boston we'll drop by.\nCURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Thank you so much.\n  Links\nProject Dumpster\nHuston-Tillotson University on Professor Jeff Wilson\nWhat It\u2019s Like To Date a Guy Who Lives In a Dumpster\nMore on issues and obstacles faced by Professor Dumpster http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/09/the-simple-life-in-a-dumpster/379947/\n  Living on Earth wants to hear from you!\nLiving on Earth\n62 Calef Highway, Suite 212\nLee, NH 03861\nTelephone: 617-287-4121\nE-mail: comments@loe.org\nNewsletter [Click here]\nDonate to Living on Earth!\nLiving on Earth is an independent media program and relies entirely on contributions from listeners and institutions supporting public service.

His work on sustainability and minimalism has been covered broadly by publications like Forbes, The Atlantic, NY Times, and The Washington Post.\n\n\nJeff talked to us about his \u201cDumpster Project\u201d as well as his previous and current startup ventures. As an entrepreneur, Jeff has founded and built a micro housing startup, Kasita, that was sold off in 2018. Jeff\u2019s latest company Jupe, has been a part of the recent Y Combinator batch, and Jeff also highlights what he learned from that experience.\n\n\nIn our conversation with Jeff we also discuss the details of how his current product works, the challenges of building a hardware company, picking the right co-founder, and\u2026 fundraising at the urinals.\nEpisode transcript\nGreg Miaskiewicz:\nSo, we'd like to talk about the very beginning stories on Startup Foundations. So how did you first become an entrepreneur? How did you get interested in big business startups, high-intensity interval capitalism?\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nI like that term. Is there an acronym?\n\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz: It's HIIC.\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nHIIC. Well, I'm a sixth generation Texan.\n\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz: Natural born HIIC.\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nSo it's a weird story. I've been an environmental science professor, a tenured professor. Safest job in the world. I decided I wanted to do this experiment around minimal living and around waste. So I convinced the university administration, to let me live in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year. An actual used trash dumpster and convert into a home. When you have aspirations as a professor of being part of the 1%, it's probably going to have nothing to do with wealth.\n\n\nSo I just went with, I'll live in 1% the volume of the average American home, own 1% of the stuff and consume 1% of the energy and water.\nSo did this and began moving my little dumpster house around the city and playing with coding officials and planning and learning how to design small spaces. And at one point, as you're laying in your dumpster at night, looking up at the heavens through the roof, this idea came to me of making the iPhone of housing. An integrated piece of hardware and software.\n\n\nOf course, there's an iPhone at Tesla and Uber and everything I learned later. But it seemed like a good\nenough idea. I moved out of the dumpster, raised my first check and started a company called Kasita.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD FULL TRANSCRIPT\nVideo Clips from Episode\nQUESTION | 2:16\nHow did you first become an entrepreneur?\nWATCH\nQUESTION | 2:26\nHow did you get your first money in the door?\nWATCH\nQUESTION | 2:41\nWhat should first-time founder look for when picking a co-founder?\nWATCH\nMore ways to listen\nSPOTIFY\nAPPLE\nSPREAKER\nGOOGLE\nRelated Episodes\nReady to get started?\nCreating a company on Capbase is as easy as filling out a few forms.\nSIGN UP NOW\nCHAT NOW\nDon't pay until you are ready to incorporate\nStartup founders use Capbase to incorporate, issue stock, raise funds, onboard new hires, and more.\nPRODUCT\nHome\nFeatures\nPricing\nHelp Center\nFAQ\nStartup Equity Calculator\nCapbase Connect\nCOMPANY\nAbout\nBlog\nPodcast\nContact\nTOPICS WE WRITE ABOUT\nSTARTUP FUNDRAISING\nINCORPORATION\nFOUNDER EQUITY\nSTARTUP EQUITY\nSTARTUP COMPLIANCE\nSTARTUP FINANCE\nGUIDES FOR BUILDING YOUR STARTUP\nFundraising For Startups\n15 ARTICLES\nHow To Set Up Your Company\n19 ARTICLES\nOngoing Compliance For Startups\n11 ARTICLES\nStartup Equity\n12 ARTICLES\nINCORPORATION MATTERS\nHow To Register A US Business From Mexico\nHow To Register a US Company from Nigeria\nDelaware Corporation Search: Check if your name is available in DE\nRead more\nFOUNDER EQUITY MATTERS\nHow Much Equity Should You Give to Your Junior Co-Founder?\nWhat Startup Founders Should Know About Capital Gains Tax\nWhat is a down round in startup financing?\nRead more\nSTARTUP EQUITY MATTERS\nLiquidation preference: A Guide For Startup Founders\nWhat is a down round in startup financing?\nPreferred Stock: Quick Guide For Startup Founders\nRead more\nTerms of servicePrivacy policy",

The dumpster has got little but a mattress, A/C window unit, and a false floor under which he can keep his clothing and cooking equipment.\nThe backstory on Wilson\u2019s decision to begin the experiment is basically what you might expect, if you had to guess. As the Washington Post explained in its exit-interview with Wilson, after he moved out of his dumpster home: \n[H]e was living in a comfortable, 3,000-square-foot Brownsville, Tex., home with a large walk-in closet, an easily accessible bathroom and a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. He had a tenure-track professorship at a state university, an hour-long commute and a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\nToday, Wilson has none of those things \u2014 and insists that he\u2019s never been happier.\nBetween then and now, there was a divorce, a new job in a new city, a surrendering of worldly possessions, a new social arrangement with a new romantic partner and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 an olive green dumpster that he called home.\nWilson\u2019s stunt got lots of attention because the ideas behind Wilson\u2019s dumpster life are fashionable. The \u201cTiny Houses\u201d movement has picked up speed in the wake of the 2007-2008 recession. IKEA stores, perhaps in a nod to their European roots, make big shows of demonstrating how comfortable a two-hundred-square-foot living space can be. \nAccording to the FAQ on the Dumpster Project website, the focus of Wilson\u2019s year-long stunt was much bigger than just one professor: \nThis whole endeavor is way more than a weird professor living in a metal wastebasket. Beyond the obvious goal of creating one of the smallest sustainable living spaces on the planet, the project is heavily focused on engaging students and enhancing the Huston-Tillotson campus where it\u2019s located. Ultimately we\u2019re partnering with students to create a lively (and entertaining) discussion about what a good, sustainable life can look like and how to make that life available to more communities.\nAlthough Wilson\u2019s website may have noted that \u201cif all goes well, Professor Dumpster has stated that he is not opposed to taking up permanent residence in his dumpster dwelling,\u201d he\u2019s out of it now\u2014and of course he\u2019s on to his next project. \nThe new social experiment or whatever it is that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin. Pretty self-explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime\u2014right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nPOPULAR VIDEOS\nPrevious\nNext\nThe Story: Writer Sarah Hepola on \"What Cheer Led To\"\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 13 seconds\nMORE\nThe Story: Writer Sarah Hepola on \"What Cheer Led To\"\nThe Best Mexico City Street Tacos in Austin\nLet\u2019s just quickly acknowledge the irony that a guy whose famously minimalist lifestyle included \u201ceight or nine bowties\u201d is now mocking hipster trappings like music festivals and craft-beer tastings. Okay, moving on, his project appears to be a bit of Morgan Spurlock-like first-person investigation: Wilson will sleep on couches to see a variety of ways that people in Austin live, with a photographer and writer in tow to document the experience. He is also seeking sponsors.\nBut how revelatory can 99 Nights ATX really be? The project will limit him to a self-selected group of homes by its nature\u2014he can only go where he\u2019s invited, obviously\u2014and it\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms, though it seems mostly harmless. (update: after this post went live, Wilson removed the \u201cpartners\u201d link from the 99 Nights ATX website; the page is cached here.)\nStill, if your reaction to all of Wilson\u2019s projects is that something feels off, well, you\u2019re not alone. Most stories about Wilson feature commentary from readers who take issue with the fact that he\u2019s becoming a minor celebrity through these gimmicks, and that\u2019s understandable. \nThere are already people who live in dumpsters without A/C units or garden gnomes or eight to nine bowties, of course\u2014it\u2019s just that they\u2019re homeless. They\u2019re unlikely to end up enjoying media attention from \u201cThe Atlantic, MSNBC, NPR, BBC, HuffPo, USA Today, CNET, Fast Company, The Guardian,The Weather Channel, Al Jazeera & 200+ others,\u201d as the page on his 99 Nights website boasts. They don\u2019t get sponsorship opportunities at all, and they\u2019re unlikely to be able to parlay their experience into a book deal, something Wilson told the Washington Post was on his agenda.\nSimilarly, there are a lot of people who sleep on couches whose \u201csocial experiment\u201d is based on having nowhere else to go. The National Coalition for the Homeless reports that an estimated 1.65 percent of the population is \u201ccouch-homeless,\u201d or people who have no permanent residence but stay with friends or family. In Dallas youth shelter Promise House claimed in 2008 that roughly one thousand homeless teenagers in the city are \u201csofa-surfers\u201d (full disclosure: my mother-in-law is the former executive director of Promise House). In the UK, sofa-surfing homelessness is an issue getting serious attention as part of a campaign to consider the mostly-invisible homeless population.\nWilson\u2019s website talked about sustainability and furthering the availability of sustainable living to more communities, but his own project was buoyed by extensive corporate sponsorship from Ford and Freescale as well as other corporations, and a pair of local hipster home outfitting retailers interested in being associated with Wilson\u2019s impressive media reach. (If any of these sponsors want to invest in things that benefit people in need of low-cost sustainable housing, we might suggest a few other worthy causes.)\nAlso, living in a dumpster is also actually illegal, unless you happen to own the dumpster in question. (Wilson was able to secure permission to occupy his particular dumpster from the university.)\nNone of that makes the fun, quirky \u201cexperiments\u201d that Wilson is performing wrong, but it does make them kind of obtuse. Wilson\u2019s experiments are fundamentally about homelessness\u2014you don\u2019t move into a dumpster unaware of the association\u2014but when he talks about \u201cWhat does home look like in a world of ten billion people\u201d by celebrating the gimmicks behind what he\u2019s doing, there\u2019s an important thing he\u2019s missing: for many people, it just looks a lot like living in a f#%$ing dumpster.  \nWe certainly don\u2019t wish Wilson ill as he brings his bowties into 99 different people\u2019s homes, but it\u2019s hard not to see these projects as very interesting ways for the guy to get on television and in magazines, creating opportunities for corporate partners to co-brand #DumpsterLife or #CouchSurfing as a quirky way to challenge middle-class conceptions of how we live. But if the majority of the time we spend talking about people who live in dumpsters or on other people\u2019s couches involves a university professor on the hunt for a book deal, we\u2019re not creating an interesting dialogue. We\u2019re avoiding one. \n(AP Photo/Austin American-Statesman, Laura Skelding.)\nHome\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nEmail a link to this page\nComments\n0\nShow More\nRECOMMENDED\nSTYLE & DESIGN\n\u201cGranny Flats\u201d Could Remake the Housing Market.

This is relevant to the story only because New Line Cinema bought the rights to turn that story into a rom-com.\nIn 2014, Wilson moved into a dumpster behind the women\u2019s dormitory at Huston-Tillotson University in East Austin. Over the past year, Wilson converted the dumpster into a tiny home, complete with air conditioning \u2014 it is Austin, after all \u2014 as well as the full support of the university where he is both professor and dean of the University College. A student group, Green Is the New Black, helped him with his project and slept in the dumpster on nights when Wilson elected to sleep elsewhere.\nThis is where people, including me, begin to project their own emotions onto the story: why did he pick the dumpster behind the women\u2019s dorm? Why do I feel weird about students sleeping over in their professor\u2019s living space, even if he isn\u2019t there? How does Wilson balance dumpster life with parenting his elementary-school-aged daughter? (Wilson is divorced and it appears that his ex-wife has primary custody of their daughter.)\nAnd here\u2019s one new emotion that I just picked up this morning: why did none of the Professor Dumpster articles that I read over the past year, not until the Washington Post profile I read today, mention that Huston-Tillotson University is an Historically Black College? If there are students of color who helped Professor Dumpster build his dumpster house, their faces should have been photographed next to his, alongside his bow tie and his Stetson.\nBut we don\u2019t have to worry about any of that anymore, because Professor Dumpster is moving out of the dumpster \u2014 and if you live in Austin, he might be coming to a couch near you.\nAs the Texas Monthly reports, in an article titled \u201cWhy Professor Dumpster\u2019s Gimmicks are a Bunch of Trash:\u201d\nThe new social experiment or whatever that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin \u2014 pretty self explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime \u2014 right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nYes, Professor Dumpster is going couchsurfing. (Hat tip to Billfold commenter Josh for sending us the Texas Monthly link.) The Texas Monthly notes that he\u2019s also looking for project funding \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms\u201d \u2014 but when I follow the link to his 99 Nights ATX sponsor page it looks like he\u2019s actually looking for corporate sponsors, which probably has more to do with raising the profile of his experiment than crowdfunding his couchsurfing.\nHere\u2019s how 99 Nights ATX describes the project:\nJeff will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their inner spaces. Sarah Natsumi Moore, an established Austin photographer, will document the journey with her camera and Clara Bensen, a local writer, will compile short stories to accompany each home.\nWe will learn a lot about the former Professor Dumpster and his team by the people he chooses to stay with and the stories his team chooses to tell about them.\nAfter all, it\u2019s pretty clear what story I\u2019m choosing to tell about Professor Dumpster.\nPhoto credit: PhotoAtelier\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\nDistraction-free reading.

Eventually, he hopes to turn his new home into a full-on \u201cspace capsule in a trash can\u201d with WiFi, air conditioning, an Xbox and other modern luxuries. The yearlong class experiment, called The Dumpster Project, is out to prove that people can live in a lot less space but still have a rich\u2014if not richer\u2014life.\nWho did you consult with for the project?\nI recruited a world-class team that includes one of the top green designers in the world, one of the top water energy experts and people in the STEM education community. They\u2019re acting as an advisory board. But the students do the real design and thought-process work on this.\nWhy a dumpster and not some other small space?\nYou get a very shocking reaction when you tell people at a cocktail party that you\u2019re living in a dumpster. They don\u2019t say, \u201cThat\u2019s great. The weather tomorrow looks terrible.\u201d The experiment fuels a very long conversation within and between groups that don\u2019t traditionally talk about issues of living with less and sustainability.\nAny thoughts on how this will affect your personal life?\nMy mom is a Martha Stewart\u2013type and very concerned about image. If someone brings it up at her bridge club, it pokes her a little bit, but I think she secretly likes it. My girlfriend has always known [about the project]. I think once I actually move in, it will become difficult. I\u2019m on campus, so there are visitation hours.\nWill you be entertaining in your new place?\nOh yeah. We\u2019re going to have a dumpster-warming party when I move in. I want to have a couple of chairs out in the yard and a little back porch. It\u2019s one of the best views in Austin. A thousand-dollar home with a million-dollar view.\nPopular Articles\nWhy Is Austin Dating So Cursed?\nA Major Developer\u2019s Collapse Leaves Abandoned Projects Scattered Across Austin\nThe 25 Best Tacos in Austin\n50 Great Dates in Austin\n6 Texas Beaches Just a Short Drive From Austin\nWhat\u2019s With All These Breakups in Austin?\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nCurrent Issue\nArchives\nTRENDING NOW\n1907\u2019s Chill Summer, and Other Austin Weather Records That Might Surprise You\nThe Highland Lakes Are Rising Again!

Wilson, college dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is highlighted for his daring challenge to live inside of a 33-square-foot trash container. It\u2019s all part of the Dumpster Project, an experiment he\u2019s developing with students to build a \u201clow-impact, zero-net-waste\u201d dwelling out of the trash container.\nIt was interesting to learn about how many items of convenience Wilson has stripped from his life to place himself basically in solitary confinement: He\u2019s got no toilet or shower (he uses the university\u2019s), no washer and dryer for his clothes (he uses the laundromat), and his wardrobe is reduced to a few pairs of pants and shirts, three hats, and \u201ceight or nine\u201d bowties.\nIt\u2019s basically a crib \u2014 though when finally complete, it will be something that could possibly revive MTV Cribs. Here\u2019s what it will look like:\nGrist Weekly | The best of Grist\u2019s essential climate reporting, delivered straight to your inbox every Saturday.\nSign up now\n  This was not mentioned in the story, but his school, Huston-Tillotson, is a historically black university. The student group Hamblin does mention, Green is the New Black, is the Huston-Tillotson student organization that is driving the Dumpster Project, and it is holding its inaugural Building Green Justice Forum on campus on Sept. 25.\nHuston-Tillotson is spotlighted in the a report I just wrote about that highlights environmental work and progress at historically black schools. In particular Huston-Tillotson gets props for its Dumpster 101 curriculum, based on this project, and also its off-campus activity, like the STEM program it\u2019s created for K-12 classes. It\u2019s kinda criminal that this university didn\u2019t make the Sierra Club\u2019s or Princeton\u2019s \u201cgreenest schools\u201d lists based on this dumpster-ology alone.\nWhich brings me to another item left out of the story: That East Austin, where Wilson\u2019s dumpster home and the university are located, is an area where African Americans and Latinos have historically lived segregated from the rest of the city. This racial segregation is by design, which you can read about in Cecilia Balli\u2019s Texas Monthly story, or Luke Winkie\u2019s in Vice. It\u2019s part of why Austin is considered the 10th most segregated city in the nation.\nEast Austin is showing signs of gentrification, however. And Wilson himself could be easily taken for one of those caricatured-too-much hipsters encroaching upon black territory. He\u2019s white. He has \u201ceight or nine bowties.\u201d But his Dumpster story charts a different path.\nThe lack of space in Wilson\u2019s pod has pushed him into more intimate contact with his neighbors. As noted in the story:\nHe spent a lot more time out in the community, just walking around. \u201cI almost feel like East Austin is my home and backyard,\u201c he said. He is constantly thinking about what sorts of things a person really needs in a house, and what can be more communal.\n\u201cWhat if everybody had to go to some sort of laundromat?\u201d Wilson posited. \u201cHow would that shift how we have to, or get to, interact with others? I know I have met a much wider circle of people just from going to laundromats and wandering around outside of the dumpster when I would\u2019ve been in there if I had a large flat screen and a La-Z Boy.\u201d \u2026\nHe\u2019s also welcoming of anyone who wants to stop by the dumpster and talk sustainability any time. \u2026 On some nights, Wilson will stay with a friend, and students from the ecology-focused campus group Green Is the New Black will get a night to stay in the dumpster.\nOne of the biggest gripes about gentrification is that the invasive species moving in often seclude themselves from the natives, throwing off community chemistry. But Wilson\u2019s dumpster is not a white sanctuary among black residents. Community is part of his intention. Also, since his place of rest is not a house, his occupation has not lead to someone else\u2019s displacement, another prime feature of gentrification.\nNow obviously we can\u2019t all live in dumpsters to avoid pushing people out of their homes. But I like the kind of thinking that Wilson\u2019s dumpster model hopefully inspires: How can we get in front of the problems often created in the gentrifying process? One way is not to ignore race, but rather to purposefully engage  it.\nA message from   \nAll donations matched for a limited time!\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the 'new 1%' will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home,\" reads The Dumpster Project website.\nWe first came across Wilson over at The Atlantic, where they describe his downsizing from a 2,500-square-foot house to a 500-square-foot apartment and finally to the 36-square-foot dumpster. For reference, that's 152 square feet less than the self-proclaimed \"world's smallest house\" in London, 204 square feet less than a typical $30,000 tiny house, and 92 square feet smaller than the tiny house in which a Business Insider reporter spent the weekend with her mom.\nAdvertisement\nWe were so intrigued by Wilson's project that we reached out to Team Dumpster to see if it had photos to share. We've published them here with the group's permission.\nAdvertisement\nThe Dumpster Project will be completed in three phases, starting when Wilson took occupancy in February 2014: camping in a bare-bones dumpster (shown here); living in a dumpster \"home,\" with additions such as storage and a bed; and then fine-tuning the dumpster into the ultimate sustainable home.\nSarah Natsumi Moore / The Dumpster Project\nEarlier in stage two, the project's current stage, a fake floor was installed to store Wilson's belongings and limited wardrobe.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nLater in this stage, the dumpster will be hooked up to electricity and water.

Wilson is documenting his progress on the website dumpsterproject.org, using videos and social media to showcase his sustainable living project.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just to explore the idea of less,\u201d he told ABC station KTRK in Houston.\nProfessor Goes Green: He\u2019ll Live in Dumpster for a Year\nStudents, who helped clean the dumpster before Wilson moved in, were stunned when he announced his plan.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at all,\u201d student Charles Deshaw said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re really going to live in a dumpster?\u2019\u201d\nJeff Wilson is using a dumpster as his home at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Tx.\nThe front door slides shut. It\u2019s cold at nights. The walls contain decorative hangings. The home features few appliances such as a washer and dryer, which were added during the current phase of his project. The third and final phase will feature solar panels with a focus on renewable energy.\nFor Wilson -- who goes by the nickname \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d -- the second night in the dumpster was scariest.\n\u201cThe trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors,\u201d Wilson told KTRK.\nLuckily, Wilson\u2019s new home remained untouched by trash crews. After living in the dumpster for six months, Wilson is proud of the discourse his experiment has encouraged and that it has promoted the idea of living with less.\nIt\u2019s important to \u201cfoster a conversation and keep that conversation going.

This is relevant to the story only because New Line Cinema bought the rights to turn that story into a rom-com.\nIn 2014, Wilson moved into a dumpster behind the women\u2019s dormitory at Huston-Tillotson University in East Austin. Over the past year, Wilson converted the dumpster into a tiny home, complete with air conditioning \u2014 it is Austin, after all \u2014 as well as the full support of the university where he is both professor and dean of the University College. A student group, Green Is the New Black, helped him with his project and slept in the dumpster on nights when Wilson elected to sleep elsewhere.\nThis is where people, including me, begin to project their own emotions onto the story: why did he pick the dumpster behind the women\u2019s dorm? Why do I feel weird about students sleeping over in their professor\u2019s living space, even if he isn\u2019t there? How does Wilson balance dumpster life with parenting his elementary-school-aged daughter? (Wilson is divorced and it appears that his ex-wife has primary custody of their daughter.)\nAnd here\u2019s one new emotion that I just picked up this morning: why did none of the Professor Dumpster articles that I read over the past year, not until the Washington Post profile I read today, mention that Huston-Tillotson University is an Historically Black College? If there are students of color who helped Professor Dumpster build his dumpster house, their faces should have been photographed next to his, alongside his bow tie and his Stetson.\nBut we don\u2019t have to worry about any of that anymore, because Professor Dumpster is moving out of the dumpster \u2014 and if you live in Austin, he might be coming to a couch near you.\nAs the Texas Monthly reports, in an article titled \u201cWhy Professor Dumpster\u2019s Gimmicks are a Bunch of Trash:\u201d\nThe new social experiment or whatever that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin \u2014 pretty self explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime \u2014 right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nYes, Professor Dumpster is going couchsurfing. (Hat tip to Billfold commenter Josh for sending us the Texas Monthly link.) The Texas Monthly notes that he\u2019s also looking for project funding \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms\u201d \u2014 but when I follow the link to his 99 Nights ATX sponsor page it looks like he\u2019s actually looking for corporate sponsors, which probably has more to do with raising the profile of his experiment than crowdfunding his couchsurfing.\nHere\u2019s how 99 Nights ATX describes the project:\nJeff will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their inner spaces. Sarah Natsumi Moore, an established Austin photographer, will document the journey with her camera and Clara Bensen, a local writer, will compile short stories to accompany each home.\nWe will learn a lot about the former Professor Dumpster and his team by the people he chooses to stay with and the stories his team chooses to tell about them.\nAfter all, it\u2019s pretty clear what story I\u2019m choosing to tell about Professor Dumpster.\nPhoto credit: PhotoAtelier\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\nDistraction-free reading.

This is a question best pondered, it seems, from the inside of a Dumpster \u2013 which is why Jeff Wilson, a dean and associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, decided to move into one this past February. It seemed the perfect testing ground for the theory that \"less is more.\" Wilson intends to stay there one year, during which time \u2013 assuming all goes well with a $100,000 Kickstarter campaign ending July 1 \u2013 he and students will transform the Dumpster into a \"sustainable house and interactive teaching lab\" that uses only \"1% of the water, energy, and space of the average American home.\" As Wilson likes to say, \"It's the new one percent.\"\nAccording to the current design proposal on Kickstarter, the Dumpster's final stage of transformation (\"Phase 3: Space Capsule \u00dcber Dumpster\") will feature a \"pop-up\" second story, sleeping loft, \"folding balcony,\" composting toilet, solar shower, and rooftop rain collection system. For portability, it will tuck back together into its original form like George Jetson's briefcase. The whole experiment will be accessible \"in real time\" thanks to \"dumpster cams and a data feed with current dumpster conditions.\"\nFinal plans for a livable Dumpster (Image courtesy of Jeff Wilson)\nCurrent Dumpster conditions for now are more modest and mosquito-ridden \u2013 though, as Wilson notes, \"What's nice about a 33-square-foot house is you can just net the whole thing.\" While he's become adept at leaping through the Dumpster's side window, he provides guests with a repurposed swimming-pool ladder. Inside, all appears clean, thanks to a vigorous run through a \"car wash on steroids\" at the Texas Disposal Systems' facility. None\u00adthe\u00adless, says Wilson, \"My girlfriend swears she can still smell a hint of barbecue. Maybe we got lucky and got a Dumpster from behind Franklin's Bar\u00adbecue.\" Art by Wilson's 6-year-old daughter adorns the walls, solar-powered gadgets charge his iPhone and track indoor temperature, and raised floor panels hide clothes stored underneath. At night, he sleeps on a Kazakh mat. Being an inch taller than the Dumpster is wide, he lies diagonally across the six-by-six-foot space (along the hypotenuse, in professor language). In the mornings, he makes Turkish coffee and tends his garden with water lugged by foot from Lady Bird Lake.\nThere is also a considerable element of theatre. Notably, Wilson does these things while donning the role of his bespectacled, bow tie-clad alter ego, \"Professor Dump\u00adster.\" With an affinity for pithy bons mots and puns (his email signature is \"at your disposal\"), Wilson has infused the project with a winking irreverence. His move-in during February's long cold spell drew news coverage from as far away as the UK, which suggests that the Dumpster is precisely the \"conversation box\" it's intended to be. The Professor also appeals to students. In the spring, Blackshear Ele\u00adment\u00adary School fifth graders joined in to test soil, filter water, and build garden beds. At year's end, Professor Dumpster spoke at the students' graduation. This kind of hands-on learning is particularly meaningful, says Blackshear Principal Betty Jen\u00adkins, and it builds much-needed college awareness.\nAmanda Masino, an HT assistant professor of biology, helps develop \"experiential, design-based, and inquiry-based\" curricula around the project, using \"the same challenge but modifying it based on grade level,\" she says. A Dumpster 101 class brings HT students into the project, which is generating lessons beyond simply tracking energy and water use. Students will be analyzing DNA swabbed from the Dump\u00adster's interior, for example, and sampling Wilson's blood to track his stress levels. There are also policy issues to be explored, such as the limits building codes impose on design.\nThe project has significance for students beyond the classroom. Last fall, they thought it was \"strange\" when Wilson proposed living in a Dumpster, says sophomore Angelica Erazo, but they rallied around the sustainability idea. \"We decided to come up with an organization to help push that issue, as well as create environmental awareness in the Eastside community,\" she says. Erazo co-founded Green Is the New Black, a student group promoting a campuswide initiative to reduce water and energy use. The organization recently won $10,000 from Home Depot in the Retool Your School challenge. The group is also focused on bringing minorities into the environmental conversations of which, Erazo notes, they've often been left out. Because affordability is a major part of that conversation for low-income communities, she hopes to clear up the misconception that being environmentally friendly has to be expensive. \"You can save money being green,\" she says, pointing to simple behaviors like turning off the lights.\nThe Dumpster Project is not one of those money-saving endeavors \u2013 at least not yet. While the point right now is to bring the brightest designers and best technological expertise to the experiment, says Wilson, affordability is central to the ultimate goal of developing a sustainable model of living. \"This may be a $100,000 Dumpster home,\" says Wilson, \"but the next project might be the tiniest house built to code, and the next could be a tiny home for under $20,000.\"\nGot something to say on the subject?

This is a question best pondered, it seems, from the inside of a Dumpster \u2013 which is why Jeff Wilson, a dean and associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, decided to move into one this past February. It seemed the perfect testing ground for the theory that \"less is more.\" Wilson intends to stay there one year, during which time \u2013 assuming all goes well with a $100,000 Kickstarter campaign ending July 1 \u2013 he and students will transform the Dumpster into a \"sustainable house and interactive teaching lab\" that uses only \"1% of the water, energy, and space of the average American home.\" As Wilson likes to say, \"It's the new one percent.\"\nAccording to the current design proposal on Kickstarter, the Dumpster's final stage of transformation (\"Phase 3: Space Capsule \u00dcber Dumpster\") will feature a \"pop-up\" second story, sleeping loft, \"folding balcony,\" composting toilet, solar shower, and rooftop rain collection system. For portability, it will tuck back together into its original form like George Jetson's briefcase. The whole experiment will be accessible \"in real time\" thanks to \"dumpster cams and a data feed with current dumpster conditions.\"\nFinal plans for a livable Dumpster (Image courtesy of Jeff Wilson)\nCurrent Dumpster conditions for now are more modest and mosquito-ridden \u2013 though, as Wilson notes, \"What's nice about a 33-square-foot house is you can just net the whole thing.\" While he's become adept at leaping through the Dumpster's side window, he provides guests with a repurposed swimming-pool ladder. Inside, all appears clean, thanks to a vigorous run through a \"car wash on steroids\" at the Texas Disposal Systems' facility. None\u00adthe\u00adless, says Wilson, \"My girlfriend swears she can still smell a hint of barbecue. Maybe we got lucky and got a Dumpster from behind Franklin's Bar\u00adbecue.\" Art by Wilson's 6-year-old daughter adorns the walls, solar-powered gadgets charge his iPhone and track indoor temperature, and raised floor panels hide clothes stored underneath. At night, he sleeps on a Kazakh mat. Being an inch taller than the Dumpster is wide, he lies diagonally across the six-by-six-foot space (along the hypotenuse, in professor language). In the mornings, he makes Turkish coffee and tends his garden with water lugged by foot from Lady Bird Lake.\nThere is also a considerable element of theatre. Notably, Wilson does these things while donning the role of his bespectacled, bow tie-clad alter ego, \"Professor Dump\u00adster.\" With an affinity for pithy bons mots and puns (his email signature is \"at your disposal\"), Wilson has infused the project with a winking irreverence. His move-in during February's long cold spell drew news coverage from as far away as the UK, which suggests that the Dumpster is precisely the \"conversation box\" it's intended to be. The Professor also appeals to students. In the spring, Blackshear Ele\u00adment\u00adary School fifth graders joined in to test soil, filter water, and build garden beds. At year's end, Professor Dumpster spoke at the students' graduation. This kind of hands-on learning is particularly meaningful, says Blackshear Principal Betty Jen\u00adkins, and it builds much-needed college awareness.\nAmanda Masino, an HT assistant professor of biology, helps develop \"experiential, design-based, and inquiry-based\" curricula around the project, using \"the same challenge but modifying it based on grade level,\" she says. A Dumpster 101 class brings HT students into the project, which is generating lessons beyond simply tracking energy and water use. Students will be analyzing DNA swabbed from the Dump\u00adster's interior, for example, and sampling Wilson's blood to track his stress levels. There are also policy issues to be explored, such as the limits building codes impose on design.\nThe project has significance for students beyond the classroom. Last fall, they thought it was \"strange\" when Wilson proposed living in a Dumpster, says sophomore Angelica Erazo, but they rallied around the sustainability idea. \"We decided to come up with an organization to help push that issue, as well as create environmental awareness in the Eastside community,\" she says. Erazo co-founded Green Is the New Black, a student group promoting a campuswide initiative to reduce water and energy use. The organization recently won $10,000 from Home Depot in the Retool Your School challenge. The group is also focused on bringing minorities into the environmental conversations of which, Erazo notes, they've often been left out. Because affordability is a major part of that conversation for low-income communities, she hopes to clear up the misconception that being environmentally friendly has to be expensive. \"You can save money being green,\" she says, pointing to simple behaviors like turning off the lights.\nThe Dumpster Project is not one of those money-saving endeavors \u2013 at least not yet. While the point right now is to bring the brightest designers and best technological expertise to the experiment, says Wilson, affordability is central to the ultimate goal of developing a sustainable model of living. \"This may be a $100,000 Dumpster home,\" says Wilson, \"but the next project might be the tiniest house built to code, and the next could be a tiny home for under $20,000.\"\nGot something to say on the subject?

He\u2019s an environmental science professor at Huston-Tillotson University (HTU) AND a dean!\nI had to meet him when I flew into Austin for a board meeting earlier this month.\nWhat\u2019s his story?\nHe\u2019s the test variable in his own research, exploring the boundaries of conventional living options.\nCan one live in a space of 36-square feet?\nThe first half of the year, he endured sparse amenities, sponge baths at a sink in one of the university\u2019s bathrooms, and sub-freezing nights. The second half of the year, he added some creature comforts with air conditioning and a futon bed.\nAs a professor, he inspires by example. His students remain curious about sustainability in their own lives. He welcomes teachers to spend a night through his Dumpster Project \u201cHome\u201d School residency program. (Scroll to \u201cEducation Programs\u201d in the PDF that opens.) His DumpterProject.org even offers educational opportunities for 5th and 7th grade science\u2014helping young people understand sustainability of water, food, and energy.\nWhat unfolded was quite unexpected.\nWe met for breakfast on a rainy morning at a small neighborhood restaurant two miles east of the Capitol.\nDonning a professorial corduroy sport coat over a plaid shirt with bowtie, and heavy black-framed glasses topped with a Stetson will catch anyone\u2019s attention!  That adventurous mix caught mine.\nHe is letting go.\nHe picked up the tab for breakfast. I objected since I had invited him to meet with me. He explained that\u2019s what the money is for\u2014to let it go. Although, he\u2019s not giving away money, he is testing many of the conventions of day-to-day living we often take for granted.\nHe just sold his car the evening before we met, choosing to get around town on an electric bicycle or on foot.\nAfter breakfast, we walked to the University to see the Dumpster. I looked inside and took a few pictures. (It had just been painted.) We went to his office to continue our discussion.\nWhat is he trying to prove?\nHe\u2019s asked this question, frequently. Anytime, anyone endeavors to do something that defies convention, amateur psychologists gather to decode the pioneer\u2019s psyche by delving into the past.\nWas it something from his childhood?\n I was curious about his childhood. He recalls trying to arrange Legos in ways that reflect principles of feng shui. He remembers most horizontal surfaces filled with stuff. In STUFFology 101, there\u2019s a reference to tilting horizontal surfaces to prevent the accumulation of POOP (Piles of Overwhelming Paperwork).\nA past relationship?\nHe was married once, but his ex-wife\u2019s and his relationship went their separate ways, amicably.\nPast profession?\nAfter a stint with Ernst & Young, he quit, because in the real world, it seems no matter how stellar one\u2019s results, there\u2019s always a leader wants things done a certain way.\nSometimes, people do things for reasons we\u2019re unable to understand.\nHe\u2019s not trying to change our behavior.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to do anything.\u201d He doesn\u2019t expect the world\u2019s population to live in dumpsters. Although, a dumpster would be desirable shelter for billions who live in poverty.\nHe\u2019s not even trying to prove a point.\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing my own thing.\u201d He\u2019s stretching the boundaries of how we choose to live while exploring sustainable options. He\u2019s conducting \u201cradical personal experiments that have the potential to make a ripple in society.\u201d He\u2019s \u201cinspired by people who sell their home, buy an RV, and travel. It\u2019s a freeing feeling.\u201d\nWhy a Dumpster?\n\u201cThe dumpster is a metaphor for the dichotomy between our sacred space (where we live) and the waste we throw away. The crap we don\u2019t want disappears when we toss it in a dumpster.\u201d Bringing together such disparate elements \u201cserves as a symbol and a surprise.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next?\nHis goal is to explore \u201chow to build a beautiful home for the price of a car payment in the middle of a city.\u201d\nHis research is inspiring. His experiments are lessons in letting go while letting in the world of adventure through sustainable living. He inspires a growing community of us with greater awareness of the cumulative global impact of our feature-rich lifestyles.\nBy letting go of things we often think are necessary, he has created a life of freedom, flexibility, and fun. For example, he and his girlfriend/writer, Clara Bensen, completed several trips to different countries around the world without any baggage. Read more on his Wikipedia page.\nI hope he doesn\u2019t let go of the gift of STUFFology 101: Get Your Mind out of the Clutter, I was happy to sign for him.\n  Tags: Letting go, piles of overwhelming paperwork, POOP, Professor Dumpster, STUFFology 101 book\nYou might also like\n1\nREPLY\nEric Riddle STUFFologist\nApril 23, 2015 at 8:56 am\nWow, talk about letting go of stuff!\nThere is some pretty cool information as you click through the various links.

For \u201cThe Ultimate Conversation Box: A Dumpster,\u201d Dr. Wilson will be describing how he links his academic research, teaching, and community activism with issues of sustainability as well as with his role as a dean at Huston-Tillotson University. Wilson will also give a \u201ctour\u201d of his dumpster/home.\nHere\u2019s what a recent piece in The Atlantic had to say about him:\nProfessor Wilson went to the dumpster not just because he wished to live deliberately, and not just to teach his students about the environmental impacts of day-to-day life, and not just to gradually transform the dumpster into \u201cthe most thoughtfully-designed, tiniest home ever constructed.\u201d Wilson\u2019s reasons are a tapestry of these things.\n[\u2026]\nNot long ago, Wilson was nesting in a 2,500 square foot house. After going through a divorce (\u201cnothing related to the dumpster,\u201d he told me, unsolicited), he spun into the archetypal downsizing of a newly minted bachelor. He moved into a 500-square-foot apartment. Then he began selling clothes and furniture on Facebook for almost nothing. Now he says almost everything he owns is in his 36-square-foot dumpster, which is sanctioned and supported by the university as part of an ongoing sustainability-focused experiment called The Dumpster Project. \u201cWe could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson said at the launch, \u201c[fueled by] sunlight and surface water, and people could have a pretty good life.\u201d\n[\u2026]\nFor Professor Dumpster, the undertaking is at once grand and diminutive, selfless and introspective, silly and gravely important, even dark. \u201cWe bring everything into the home these days,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to leave the home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home.\u201d\n\u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\nThe talk will take place Friday, September 26 at 4:30 in Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s AL Auditorium at 900 Chicon Street.\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Department of American Studies, the Graduate Program in Community and Regional Planning, and Plan II Honors.

An environmental science professor is making a 33-square-foot dumpster his new home for the next year.\nHis name is Dr. Jeff Wilson, but since embarking on this journey, he's now going by Professor Dumpster.\nHe teaches at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, and received his Ph.D. from Harvard.\nThe goal is to embrace energy efficiency, and to prove that it is possible to live on a smaller scale - a much smaller scale.\nThis whole project revolves around using one percent of what an average American uses: one percent of the water, energy and waste.\nDr. Jeff Wilson checks out his new 33 square foot dumpster home. (Credit: @profdumpster/Instagram)\n\"We really needed some sort of excitement around science, sustainability and technology,\" says Wilson.\nHe says the idea came to him over two years ago. Since then he's been recruiting a world-class team of professors, scientists and environmentalists to make his idea a reality.\n\"My hypothesis is that my life will be better,\" Wilson says. \"I'll be fulfilling a richer life by living a smaller life.\"\nLast night was the first night in his new home. Wilson says that in this phase of the project, the only thing he has to keep him warm during the cold Texas nights is his sleeping bag.\nHe's embracing the simplicity, and welcoming the changes that will come in the next year of the project. Instead of being strapped down to expensive monthly rent, he'll be a homeowner with his mortgage paid off.\nBut dumpster living comes with challenges, like walking a mile down the hill to the town lake for water.\nThe outlook is positive, though. Wilson says in six months he hopes to have things like an air conditioner and an X-box. A shower, a toilet and even WiFi is in the works, too.\nDr. Wilson has a whole team behind him, including a student organization called Green is the New Black. He says team members can even volunteer to spend the night in the dumpster and give him the night off. As the project progresses, the team will be fundraising for low-energy appliances and electronics, and will monitor the energy used on the team's blog.\nHe'll be taking his dumpster home to local elementary schools and sharing his project with the students. It gives the students the opportunity to give him design ideas and ask questions. One of the most pressing so far: \"How is Santa going to get in?\"\nTo follow Dr. Wilson and his team's journey through dumpster living, check out the blog at dumpsterproject.org.\nABC News Network Privacy Policy Your US State Privacy Rights Children's Online Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads Terms of Use Do Not Sell My Info Contact Us \u00a9 2024 ABC News Internet Ventures.

Don\u2019t they know that goes in the recycling?\nWilson is one of those energetic college professors who students will remember for the rest of their lives, thanks to his imagination and creativity. Along with thinking outside the box, he\u2019ll be living in it. Truth is, students retain what their entertaining teachers tell them.\n\u201cNobody wants to hear another lecture about how the world is going to be destroyed if everybody doesn\u2019t drive a Prius,\u201d said Wilson, a seventh-generation Texan who did his postdoctoral work at Harvard University. \u201cWhat we want to do is have a party and have everybody come to the party.\u201d\nThe point of the dumpster experiment is to show that people can live with less. Wilson points out that he will be staying in a space that is a mere 1 percent the size of an average American home.\nSome of Wilson\u2019s students formed a group called Green Is The New Black and won a green-oriented student competition in Dearborn, Mich., that landed Huston-Tillotson a $75,000 grant from the Ford Foundation. Most of the money will be used for scholarships, but $20,000 of it will go to Professor Dumpster\u2019s Dumpster Project, dumpsterproject.org.\nThe dumpster, which Wilson hopes to move into by February, will be cozy. When ready, it will be set up on a concrete slab poured for the project on the Huston-Tillotson campus, at East Seventh and Chicon streets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the same size as this booth, maybe a little bit smaller,\u201d Wilson said, as we ate lunch in a restaurant near downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s six by six.\u201d Forget about stretching out. \u201cI\u2019ll fit in there at an angle,\u201d Wilson added. Actually, the Dumpster Project will use two dumpsters provided by Texas Disposal Systems \u2014 one for Wilson\u2019s living arrangements and one to conduct environmental experiments in Wilson\u2019s Dumpster 101 lab.\n\u201cSomebody said it was a cross between Bill Nye (the Science Guy), Thoreau and Oscar the Grouch,\u201d Wilson said.\nWilson\u2019s students are pumped. \u201cI think he deserves some sort of plaque or something,\u201d said Olivia Sanchez, a Huston-Tillotson senior majoring in biology with a concentration on environmental science.\nWilson\u2019s year in a dumpster will run through various stages.\nDuring the first stage, Wilson will rough it. \u201cDumpster camping,\u201d he calls it. It will be him and four metal walls, and that\u2019s it. Although he will have the dumpster scrubbed for nasties before he climbs in the side door. The dumpster cleaning will provide another teaching opportunity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to show the kids blown-up microscopic images of what was in the dumpster before Professor Dumpster moved into it as a home,\u201d he said.\nHey Doc, what\u2019s for lunch?\n\u201cI want to do an urban forage and not buy anything at H-E-B,\u201d said Professor Dumpster, who plans to do a bit of dumpster diving during the early going.\nAs time goes on, the dumpster will be tricked out with some of the amenities of a middle-class home. Wilson plans to install a solar panel, a little composting toilet, even a shower behind the Dumpster. \u201cAll of the stuff to make it a normal American home instead of a trash can,\u201d Wilson said.\n\u201cI was trying to get a Sleep Number bed,\u201d he added. But when he walked into a mattress store to inquire, he discovered that wouldn\u2019t happen. \u201cThere was a long pause, and they said, \u2018No, we don\u2019t make dumpster home mattresses.\u2019\u201d\nWilson, who will get his water in a bucket from Lady Bird Lake, wants to involve the campus in the project. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get the track team to help me bring up the water from Lady Bird Lake as a track exercise,\u201d he said.\nWilson doesn\u2019t look like a ladies\u2019 man. He\u2019s got nerd written all over him. He wears a bowtie, an old Open Road Stetson like the one LBJ wore, black high-top Converse basketball shoes and thick-framed glasses. Still, he must be a charmer.\nWhen Wilson isn\u2019t dumpstering, he\u2019s visiting foreign countries \u2014 with no luggage. He met his girlfriend, Austin writer Clara Bensen, last year online through the OkCupid website. Then he convinced her to tour Europe with him \u2014 with no bags. Wilson and Bensen visited eight countries in 21 days with little but the clothes on their back.\nIf you can convince a woman to tour Europe without a bringing a bag the size of a circus tent, your persuasive abilities are spectacular.\n\u201cHer friends said, \u2018We don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy for going to Europe with no clothes. We just think you\u2019re crazy for going anywhere with Wilson,\u2019\u201d Wilson said.\nOK, so Bensen brought along one carry-on. \u201cShe took a purse, because she wanted to take two pairs of underwear,\u201d said Wilson, who brought only the underwear he was wearing.\nWilson explained the laundry regimen he recommends when you\u2019re traveling through Hungary, Turkey and Croatia with only a single pair of boxers.\n\u201cOn the first day, you wear your underwear under your jeans. On the second day, you go commando. And the third day, you wash clothes,\u201d he said. Is there a frat rat in America who isn\u2019t familiar with this routine? Except for the wash part.\nBy the way, Wilson doesn\u2019t figure his girlfriend will spend the year with him in his dumpster home.\n\u201cThere are visitation hours on campus, so my girlfriend can\u2019t stay overnight,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll appeal that.\u201d\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nAd\nLearn More\nA woman in her 40s drank \"Ceramide\" and her skin became\u2026\nA woman in her 40s drank \"Ceramide\" and her skin became\u2026\nURUHIME MOMOKO\n|\nAd\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

CNET Road Trip 2014 stopped by to see how the Dumpster Project could lead to healthier cities.\nDaniel Terdiman\nJuly 1, 2014 4:00 a.m. PT\n1 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nProf. Dumpster leaping\nAUSTIN, Texas -- In a world of dwindling resources, the average American lifestyle is almost certainly unsustainable. Yet most people don't have a model for how to live differently.\nThat's what Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, wants to provide. An environmental sciences professor and dean at Huston Tillotson University here, Professor Dumpster is in the middle of a project meant to prove it's possible to live super minimally, and super efficiently.\nFor a year, Professor Dumpster is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster -- outfitted, of course, for civilized living. But the goal is to do that living with zero waste, and extremely minimal use of power and water.\nAs part of Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman came to the Texas capital to see just how comfortable one can be living in a glorified trash can. Turns out, if you're willing to let go of a few creature comforts, it's not too bad.\nPlease click here to read my full story on the Dumpster Project.\n2 of 20\nDumpster Project\nDumpster Project Phase III drawing\nCurrently, the Dumpster Project is in Phase I, and Professor Dumpster and his team are actively trying to raise money to proceed to the next stages of the initiative.\nThis document shows what the project is intended to look like when it's much further along. With multiple stories, and a developed garden, this dumpster could be sophisticated living for the minimalist-inclined.\n3 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nProf. Dumpster laughing\nStanding inside the dumpster, located at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, laughs and enjoys his 33-square-foot home.\n4 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nPushing the water barrel\nIn its current state, the dumpster isn't connected to the grid in any way, which means that Professor Dumpster must get water the old-fashioned way -- by carrying it home. When he needs water, he pushes this water barrel, which holds 24 gallons, to Austin's Lady Bird Lake, an hour round-trip, where he fills it up. When he returns, he filters the water in order to make it potable.\n5 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nOn the phone\nThough the dumpster isn't connected to the grid, that doesn't mean Professor Dumpster is cut off from the world. He uses his iPhone to talk to people, and he spends much of the daylight hours at his university office, which is only a couple hundred yards away.\n6 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nHidden compartments\nAt first glance, you can't tell where Professor Dumpster keeps any of his clothes, bedding, or other important supplies. Then he opens a lid, revealing several hidden compartments under the floor.\n7 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nGarden\nOne element of the Dumpster Project is to grow a sustainable garden alongside the dumpster. Tended by Professor Dumpster and his students, the garden is turning out several kinds of vegetables.\n8 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nBaseline\nAs a way of demonstrating how much less energy and water he can live on than is used by the average American household, Professor Dumpster plans on installing a set of the average collection of household appliances next to the dumpster that he will use for a few months to establish an energy/water/waste consumption baseline. Then he will be able to compare his own usage to that of the baseline.\n9 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nIt's bigger on the inside\nAs an homage to Dr. Who and the Tardis, Professor Dumpster has a welcome mat outside the dumpster that reads \"It's bigger on the inside.\"\n10 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nCouchsurfing note\nProfessor Dumpster has not been the only one to live in the dumpster. Because it is a demonstration project, many others -- including his students -- have spent nights there. But he also opened up the dumpster to users of Couchsurfing.com, prompting this note from the first person to ever use that Web-based service to find a bed in a dumpster.\n11 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nLaying out bed pad\nBecause the dumpster's interior space is so small, Professor Dumpster must keep his bedding hidden away until he needs it.

And On\nHe's leaving the Dumpster to a new, rotating cast of residents\nBY NORA ANKRUM, FRI., FEB. 6, 2015\nprint\nwrite a letter\n\nProfessor Dumpster in his element (Photo by John Anderson)\nHas it really been a year already? Apparently so, says Huston-Tillotson University College Dean Jeff Wilson, who on Tuesday night concluded his year-in-residence in Austin's most esteemed trash can. During the depths of last winter's cold spell, the biology professor moved into a Dumpster on the west side of HT's campus with little more than a sleeping bag and an iPhone for comfort. As an experiment in \"less is more\" living, the Dumpster Project was intended to test the limits of both sustainable design and sanity. In regard to the latter, says Wilson, \"I'm way happier than before I moved into the Dumpster.\"\nIt turns out that a 6-by-6-foot metal box makes an adequate cave for reading, napping, or getting away from it all. At the same time, says Wilson, \"you're just kind of forced to engage more, and I think that's a big part of why I'm happier.\" He notes that the low rent and \"minute-and-a-half\" commute to the office don't hurt either.\n\"We didn't make it to that sort of uber-Dumpster that we wanted,\" says Wilson. \"One of the lessons learned is that it's pretty damn hard to renovate your house when you're living in it.\" A composting toilet, pop-up balcony, and other experimental design elements went unrealized. Still, the project team planted gardens, installed data monitoring equipment, and got an air-conditioning unit (more important than a bathroom, discovered Wilson). Other additions are forthcoming as part of student-driven Brainstorm for the Box design challenges.\nWilson gave the Dumpster a fresh coat of paint last week in anticipation of its next guest, Blackshear Elementary School Principal Betty Jenkins, who planned to stay overnight Wednesday to kick off the Dump\u00adster Project \"Home\" School residency program. Other resident teachers will follow (students\u00ad can nominate a teacher at www.dumpsterproject.org/homeschool). All will return to the classroom with a Dumpster 101 curriculum developed in partnership with EcoRise and Blackshear, and piloted by the roughly 1,000 K-12 students who visited the Dumpster over the last year.\nWilson, meanwhile, is postponing a return to normalcy. Instead, he'll be spending 99 nights in different homes around town (e.g., mansion, high-rise condo, nursing home, under a bridge), all documented and photographed by his partner, writer Clara Benson, and photographer Sarah Natsumi Moore. \"There's such a real housing crisis in Austin,\" says Wilson. \"This doesn't go directly to the heart of that, but it sort of dances around it a bit.\" He hopes to explore the meaning of home and to \"gather a little bit of data\" along the way. \"It would've been a pretty big culture shock to move back into a real house,\" he says. \"I've got to kind of transition.\"\nVisit www.99nightsatx.com to follow Wilson's couch-surfing journey or to nominate a home where he should stay.\nGot something to say on the subject?

Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project.[4]\nJupe[edit]\nIn 2020, Wilson launched Jupe, a flat-packed housing tech startup.[5]\nKasita[edit]\nKasita Exterior\nWilson was a Co-Founder and CEO at the startup company Kasita.[6][2][7] Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies[14] and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award.[15] Wilson has referred to Kasita as a holistic integrated product, rather than a house.[16] In December 2018, Kasita was sold to a tiny house hotel company[17] in Austin, Texas.\nThe Dumpster Project[edit]\nProfessor Dumpster in front of a dumpster\nWilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)(3) non-profit 'The Dumpster Project',[18] a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home.[19] The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant[26] and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition,[27] but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal.[28] The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity.[29] On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'.[30] Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators.[31][32] On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster.[4][33] Wilson claims that the dumpster experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.[6]\n\"No Baggage\" experiment[edit]\nWilson and Bensen in No Baggage\nTogether with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' \"No Baggage\", in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website.[34][35][36] New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones [37] to screen write the film based on a book[38] from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen.[39][40][41][42] American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.[43]\n99 Nights Couchsurfing experiment[edit]\nSubsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces.[4][44] The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.[45]\nAcademic Work[edit]\nWilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston\u2013Tillotson University in Austin, Texas.[1] He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury[46] and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.[47] Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.[48]\nReferences[edit]\n^\na b Wilson, Jeff. \"Jeff Wilson, Huston Tillotson\".

(Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nAt Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas an environmental science professor teaches sustainability by example, transforming an empty dumpster into a tiny apartment where he\u2019s lived for a year. Professor Jeff Wilson tells host Steve Curwood about life in his micro home and his long-term goals for Project Dumpster.\n\n\nTranscript\nCURWOOD: Oscar the Grouch lives in a trash can. So did Popeye the Sailor Man, but it\u2019s hardly the kind of home you\u2019d expect for a college professor. Yet Dr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, is teaching sustainability by downsizing his living quarters to the dimensions of a dumpster \u2013 a clean dumpster, mind you. Jeff Wilson joins me now from his steel abode on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, where he\u2019s Dean of the University College and teaches environmental science. Welcome to Living on Earth, Jeff, or, do you prefer, \u201cProfessor Dumpster?\u201d\nWILSON: I\u2019ll take Professor Dumpster and you\u2019re at my disposal.\nCURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Right now you're in your dumpster. What kind of headroom do you have?\nWILSON: Well, it's a standard 10 cubic yard dumpster, which means it's six foot by six foot at the base. And this one's actually quite tall; it's about seven feet.\n\nProfessor Jeff Wilson makes the most of his 36 square-foot tiny house. (Photo: Sarah\nNatsumi Moore)\nCURWOOD: I have to say, it doesn't sound like you're in a metal box. What creature comforts are there with you in dampening the acoustics?\nWILSON: Right. We're actually in the second phase of this experiment turning it into an average studio apartment. First of all, I've got a wooden false floor, so the actual height of standing room is about 6'2\" right now. I've got a window unit air conditioner. I have a few tapestries hanging on the wall. I have a twin bed and then a very small bookshelf on the corner with various things like an Oscar the Grouch mug and a Dr. Who Tardis.\nCURWOOD: You moved into your dumpster about a year ago. How come?\nWILSON: So the main point of this entire experiment is to test if one can have a pretty good life on a whole lot less. This is obviously an outlier, an extreme example of that. I've moved into 36 square feet, which is 1 percent the size of the average new American home today, so that\u2019s the ultimate goal of this. A lot of people asked why we used a dumpster instead of a tiny house or instead of even a container, and the reason we did that were some of the awareness and educational aspects of this project around addressing waste. And dumpsters, you know, are these magical boxes that we put our waste into and come back a few days later after a little bit of noise in the middle of the night, which I'm very aware of at this point, [LAUGHS] that garbage truck noise, and everything's disappeared. So we want to highlight some of those subjects as well.\n\nDr. Dumpster plans to amp up his sustainability project this winter by adding amenities such as a second story, solar panels and a composting toilet. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: By the way, what risk do run from, you know, the odd garbage truck seeing the dumpster and figuring maybe it'll dump you?\nWILSON: There is a bit of confusion, especially since all the dumpsters are still labeled no entry for humans. We have a few safety features, so that I'm not serviced. We have welded shut the front pockets, they usually pick up dumpsters with. And there also happens to be a weather station on this dumpster, so even the new guy hopefully won't mistake this dumpster for a normal trash dumpster.\nCURWOOD: Now, I'm looking at a drawing from your website entitled, \"Early thoughts on proposed designs.\" Let's see, there's solar panels, a sleeping loft, air-conditioning and heating, a water collection system, even a folding balcony. To what extent have you actually transformed that 36 square feet of metal into home sweet home?\n\nProfessor Wilson stands with his girlfriend Clara Benson outside his dumpster. (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore)\nWILSON: What we're going to do in this phase is try to make this into an average American home using normal appliances. So we're going to get a fairly normal toilet, shower head; we'll probably expand out a few of the walls to give us a little bit more space to do this. The spec that you're looking at is actually the third phase, what we call the \"uber\" dumpster, and in his phase we're going to use all the baseline data that we collected using the normal sort of stuff. In this third phase we're going to utilize solar and lower-flow type equipment so that we can hopefully get to 1 percent the usage of energy and water, and 1 percent the creation of waste of an average American home.\nCURWOOD: So what about Mother Nature? I mean, particularly what do you have in the way of plumbing?\nWILSON: This is a particularly difficult issue to deal with. Not only is it not a lot of fun urinating into a bottle when it's an emergency, or running to the nearest building in the middle of the night; it's also a problem in terms of design: dealing with waste in a healthy-type way, and also one that doesn't give off much of a fragrance in such a small space, but also by coding regulation. In Austin, it's currently not legal to have a composting toilet. What we are probably going to have to do is, you know, attach something to the outside of the dumpster or expand one of the walls and just capture that blackwater like in an RV.\n\nEgress from the dumpster can be challenging. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: So, your home, Professor Wilson, the dumpster, that is, is about 1 percent of the size of the average American home, and during your experimental year you're going to try to use only 1 percent of the water and energy of the typical home and generate only 1 percent of the average waste. So far, how's it going?\nWILSON: Well, we did quite well in the first phase because we weren't plugged into water or electricity for the first six months. The only issue is that it wasn't exactly that comfortable. When I'm moved in February we had three, what they call at least in Texas \"snow days\" meaning that it got below about 35 degrees, and generally the temperature in that phase inside, was the temperature outside. What we hope to do, not only looking at newer technologies for using less water and energy and things like solar, but also thinking a little bit more carefully about what sort of activities we use water and energy for. Most people, sort of, when they move to a smaller house,or move to a tiny home, one of the things they notice is that they spend a lot more time outdoors and a lot more time in the community. And one of the things we're interested in is the increased interactions with the community and the environment when you're in a smaller home like this, sort of what that might do for one's sort of quality-of-life and sense of experience and just the overall magic that is brought into the everyday. If you want to call it dumpster magic.\n[LAUGHS]\n\nProfessor Wilson\u2019s students peek in through the dumpster\u2019s \u201cwindow\u201d. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: Well, you certainly sound like a friendly guy, and I'm sure that you have friends, lovers, perhaps. So what kinds of guests do you have at your dumpster?\nWILSON: [LAUGHS] Well, I'll start with the latter one. I did have a girlfriend at the beginning of the experiment, and it seems that she is still around at least in the last coupleof days. And a lot of people do ask if you know this is the type of experiment that attracts the ladies, and I'll say that's a definite no. I do have frequent guests here; I don't stay in the dumpster when I have these guests\u2014and these are generally students or couch surfers. I've had people from several continents couch-surf in the dumpster; we\u2019ve got a very special guest on Thursday, I actually have the CEO of \u201ccouch-surfing\u201d itself, dumpster-surfing.\nCURWOOD: And as for your girlfriend so far she hasn't dumped you.\nWILSON: So to speak and I refrain from calling her a trashy chick.\nCURWOOD: Ooooh.\nWILSON: [LAUGHS]\nCURWOOD: So your goal for dumpster dwelling goes beyond just spending a year in a small space, it's all about educating through this project dumpster. So what do you hope to accomplish?\nWILSON: In the short-term, we've really got sort of a Zen, in the moment thing going on. We're looking to reach out to the public and reach out to our students for ideas such as ideas on this toilet. It's one of the biggest problems. I mean, the idea of a toilet, the pure ridiculousness of it\u2014that you've got to have this big piece of porcelain; you've got to have a whole sewage system. You've got to have a couple gallons of fresh water. These are some of the things that I think we're able to attack in a very small way. I mean, ultimately what this experiment is all about is not just can you be happy on a lot less, but I like to think of the dumpster as a conversation box, and as long as a conversation continues to go on, whether it be about sustainability, climate change, tiny homes or whether it be\u2014as some have suggested Obama's new housing plan\u2014as long as that conversation's going on and people are talking about it, I think we'll have accomplished our goal.\nCURWOOD: Professor Jeff Wilson teaches Environmental Studies at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Great talking to you from your dumpster. I hope you'll bring it to Boston and invite us for dinner, or maybe even a sleepover.\nWILSON: Hey, Boston or Austin, mi dumpster es tu casa, so just let me know next time you\u2019re around and when we're in Boston we'll drop by.\nCURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Thank you so much.\n  Links\nProject Dumpster\nHuston-Tillotson University on Professor Jeff Wilson\nWhat It\u2019s Like To Date a Guy Who Lives In a Dumpster\nMore on issues and obstacles faced by Professor Dumpster http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/09/the-simple-life-in-a-dumpster/379947/\n  Living on Earth wants to hear from you!\nLiving on Earth\n62 Calef Highway, Suite 212\nLee, NH 03861\nTelephone: 617-287-4121\nE-mail: comments@loe.org\nNewsletter [Click here]\nDonate to Living on Earth!\nLiving on Earth is an independent media program and relies entirely on contributions from listeners and institutions supporting public service.

His work on sustainability and minimalism has been covered broadly by publications like Forbes, The Atlantic, NY Times, and The Washington Post.\n\n\nJeff talked to us about his \u201cDumpster Project\u201d as well as his previous and current startup ventures. As an entrepreneur, Jeff has founded and built a micro housing startup, Kasita, that was sold off in 2018. Jeff\u2019s latest company Jupe, has been a part of the recent Y Combinator batch, and Jeff also highlights what he learned from that experience.\n\n\nIn our conversation with Jeff we also discuss the details of how his current product works, the challenges of building a hardware company, picking the right co-founder, and\u2026 fundraising at the urinals.\nEpisode transcript\nGreg Miaskiewicz:\nSo, we'd like to talk about the very beginning stories on Startup Foundations. So how did you first become an entrepreneur? How did you get interested in big business startups, high-intensity interval capitalism?\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nI like that term. Is there an acronym?\n\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz: It's HIIC.\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nHIIC. Well, I'm a sixth generation Texan.\n\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz: Natural born HIIC.\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nSo it's a weird story. I've been an environmental science professor, a tenured professor. Safest job in the world. I decided I wanted to do this experiment around minimal living and around waste. So I convinced the university administration, to let me live in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year. An actual used trash dumpster and convert into a home. When you have aspirations as a professor of being part of the 1%, it's probably going to have nothing to do with wealth.\n\n\nSo I just went with, I'll live in 1% the volume of the average American home, own 1% of the stuff and consume 1% of the energy and water.\nSo did this and began moving my little dumpster house around the city and playing with coding officials and planning and learning how to design small spaces. And at one point, as you're laying in your dumpster at night, looking up at the heavens through the roof, this idea came to me of making the iPhone of housing. An integrated piece of hardware and software.\n\n\nOf course, there's an iPhone at Tesla and Uber and everything I learned later. But it seemed like a good\nenough idea. I moved out of the dumpster, raised my first check and started a company called Kasita.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD FULL TRANSCRIPT\nVideo Clips from Episode\nQUESTION | 2:16\nHow did you first become an entrepreneur?\nWATCH\nQUESTION | 2:26\nHow did you get your first money in the door?\nWATCH\nQUESTION | 2:41\nWhat should first-time founder look for when picking a co-founder?\nWATCH\nMore ways to listen\nSPOTIFY\nAPPLE\nSPREAKER\nGOOGLE\nRelated Episodes\nReady to get started?\nCreating a company on Capbase is as easy as filling out a few forms.\nSIGN UP NOW\nCHAT NOW\nDon't pay until you are ready to incorporate\nStartup founders use Capbase to incorporate, issue stock, raise funds, onboard new hires, and more.\nPRODUCT\nHome\nFeatures\nPricing\nHelp Center\nFAQ\nStartup Equity Calculator\nCapbase Connect\nCOMPANY\nAbout\nBlog\nPodcast\nContact\nTOPICS WE WRITE ABOUT\nSTARTUP FUNDRAISING\nINCORPORATION\nFOUNDER EQUITY\nSTARTUP EQUITY\nSTARTUP COMPLIANCE\nSTARTUP FINANCE\nGUIDES FOR BUILDING YOUR STARTUP\nFundraising For Startups\n15 ARTICLES\nHow To Set Up Your Company\n19 ARTICLES\nOngoing Compliance For Startups\n11 ARTICLES\nStartup Equity\n12 ARTICLES\nINCORPORATION MATTERS\nHow To Register A US Business From Mexico\nHow To Register a US Company from Nigeria\nDelaware Corporation Search: Check if your name is available in DE\nRead more\nFOUNDER EQUITY MATTERS\nHow Much Equity Should You Give to Your Junior Co-Founder?\nWhat Startup Founders Should Know About Capital Gains Tax\nWhat is a down round in startup financing?\nRead more\nSTARTUP EQUITY MATTERS\nLiquidation preference: A Guide For Startup Founders\nWhat is a down round in startup financing?\nPreferred Stock: Quick Guide For Startup Founders\nRead more\nTerms of servicePrivacy policy",

The dumpster has got little but a mattress, A/C window unit, and a false floor under which he can keep his clothing and cooking equipment.\nThe backstory on Wilson\u2019s decision to begin the experiment is basically what you might expect, if you had to guess. As the Washington Post explained in its exit-interview with Wilson, after he moved out of his dumpster home: \n[H]e was living in a comfortable, 3,000-square-foot Brownsville, Tex., home with a large walk-in closet, an easily accessible bathroom and a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. He had a tenure-track professorship at a state university, an hour-long commute and a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\nToday, Wilson has none of those things \u2014 and insists that he\u2019s never been happier.\nBetween then and now, there was a divorce, a new job in a new city, a surrendering of worldly possessions, a new social arrangement with a new romantic partner and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 an olive green dumpster that he called home.\nWilson\u2019s stunt got lots of attention because the ideas behind Wilson\u2019s dumpster life are fashionable. The \u201cTiny Houses\u201d movement has picked up speed in the wake of the 2007-2008 recession. IKEA stores, perhaps in a nod to their European roots, make big shows of demonstrating how comfortable a two-hundred-square-foot living space can be. \nAccording to the FAQ on the Dumpster Project website, the focus of Wilson\u2019s year-long stunt was much bigger than just one professor: \nThis whole endeavor is way more than a weird professor living in a metal wastebasket. Beyond the obvious goal of creating one of the smallest sustainable living spaces on the planet, the project is heavily focused on engaging students and enhancing the Huston-Tillotson campus where it\u2019s located. Ultimately we\u2019re partnering with students to create a lively (and entertaining) discussion about what a good, sustainable life can look like and how to make that life available to more communities.\nAlthough Wilson\u2019s website may have noted that \u201cif all goes well, Professor Dumpster has stated that he is not opposed to taking up permanent residence in his dumpster dwelling,\u201d he\u2019s out of it now\u2014and of course he\u2019s on to his next project. \nThe new social experiment or whatever it is that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin. Pretty self-explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime\u2014right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nPOPULAR VIDEOS\nPrevious\nNext\nThe Story: Writer Sarah Hepola on \"What Cheer Led To\"\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 13 seconds\nMORE\nThe Story: Writer Sarah Hepola on \"What Cheer Led To\"\nThis Texas Teen is a Skateboarding Sensation\nLet\u2019s just quickly acknowledge the irony that a guy whose famously minimalist lifestyle included \u201ceight or nine bowties\u201d is now mocking hipster trappings like music festivals and craft-beer tastings. Okay, moving on, his project appears to be a bit of Morgan Spurlock-like first-person investigation: Wilson will sleep on couches to see a variety of ways that people in Austin live, with a photographer and writer in tow to document the experience. He is also seeking sponsors.\nBut how revelatory can 99 Nights ATX really be? The project will limit him to a self-selected group of homes by its nature\u2014he can only go where he\u2019s invited, obviously\u2014and it\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms, though it seems mostly harmless. (update: after this post went live, Wilson removed the \u201cpartners\u201d link from the 99 Nights ATX website; the page is cached here.)\nStill, if your reaction to all of Wilson\u2019s projects is that something feels off, well, you\u2019re not alone. Most stories about Wilson feature commentary from readers who take issue with the fact that he\u2019s becoming a minor celebrity through these gimmicks, and that\u2019s understandable. \nThere are already people who live in dumpsters without A/C units or garden gnomes or eight to nine bowties, of course\u2014it\u2019s just that they\u2019re homeless. They\u2019re unlikely to end up enjoying media attention from \u201cThe Atlantic, MSNBC, NPR, BBC, HuffPo, USA Today, CNET, Fast Company, The Guardian,The Weather Channel, Al Jazeera & 200+ others,\u201d as the page on his 99 Nights website boasts. They don\u2019t get sponsorship opportunities at all, and they\u2019re unlikely to be able to parlay their experience into a book deal, something Wilson told the Washington Post was on his agenda.\nSimilarly, there are a lot of people who sleep on couches whose \u201csocial experiment\u201d is based on having nowhere else to go. The National Coalition for the Homeless reports that an estimated 1.65 percent of the population is \u201ccouch-homeless,\u201d or people who have no permanent residence but stay with friends or family. In Dallas youth shelter Promise House claimed in 2008 that roughly one thousand homeless teenagers in the city are \u201csofa-surfers\u201d (full disclosure: my mother-in-law is the former executive director of Promise House). In the UK, sofa-surfing homelessness is an issue getting serious attention as part of a campaign to consider the mostly-invisible homeless population.\nWilson\u2019s website talked about sustainability and furthering the availability of sustainable living to more communities, but his own project was buoyed by extensive corporate sponsorship from Ford and Freescale as well as other corporations, and a pair of local hipster home outfitting retailers interested in being associated with Wilson\u2019s impressive media reach. (If any of these sponsors want to invest in things that benefit people in need of low-cost sustainable housing, we might suggest a few other worthy causes.)\nAlso, living in a dumpster is also actually illegal, unless you happen to own the dumpster in question. (Wilson was able to secure permission to occupy his particular dumpster from the university.)\nNone of that makes the fun, quirky \u201cexperiments\u201d that Wilson is performing wrong, but it does make them kind of obtuse. Wilson\u2019s experiments are fundamentally about homelessness\u2014you don\u2019t move into a dumpster unaware of the association\u2014but when he talks about \u201cWhat does home look like in a world of ten billion people\u201d by celebrating the gimmicks behind what he\u2019s doing, there\u2019s an important thing he\u2019s missing: for many people, it just looks a lot like living in a f#%$ing dumpster.  \nWe certainly don\u2019t wish Wilson ill as he brings his bowties into 99 different people\u2019s homes, but it\u2019s hard not to see these projects as very interesting ways for the guy to get on television and in magazines, creating opportunities for corporate partners to co-brand #DumpsterLife or #CouchSurfing as a quirky way to challenge middle-class conceptions of how we live. But if the majority of the time we spend talking about people who live in dumpsters or on other people\u2019s couches involves a university professor on the hunt for a book deal, we\u2019re not creating an interesting dialogue. We\u2019re avoiding one. \n(AP Photo/Austin American-Statesman, Laura Skelding.)\nHome\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nEmail a link to this page\nComments\n0\nShow More\nRECOMMENDED\nSTYLE & DESIGN\n\u201cGranny Flats\u201d Could Remake the Housing Market.

This is relevant to the story only because New Line Cinema bought the rights to turn that story into a rom-com.\nIn 2014, Wilson moved into a dumpster behind the women\u2019s dormitory at Huston-Tillotson University in East Austin. Over the past year, Wilson converted the dumpster into a tiny home, complete with air conditioning \u2014 it is Austin, after all \u2014 as well as the full support of the university where he is both professor and dean of the University College. A student group, Green Is the New Black, helped him with his project and slept in the dumpster on nights when Wilson elected to sleep elsewhere.\nThis is where people, including me, begin to project their own emotions onto the story: why did he pick the dumpster behind the women\u2019s dorm? Why do I feel weird about students sleeping over in their professor\u2019s living space, even if he isn\u2019t there? How does Wilson balance dumpster life with parenting his elementary-school-aged daughter? (Wilson is divorced and it appears that his ex-wife has primary custody of their daughter.)\nAnd here\u2019s one new emotion that I just picked up this morning: why did none of the Professor Dumpster articles that I read over the past year, not until the Washington Post profile I read today, mention that Huston-Tillotson University is an Historically Black College? If there are students of color who helped Professor Dumpster build his dumpster house, their faces should have been photographed next to his, alongside his bow tie and his Stetson.\nBut we don\u2019t have to worry about any of that anymore, because Professor Dumpster is moving out of the dumpster \u2014 and if you live in Austin, he might be coming to a couch near you.\nAs the Texas Monthly reports, in an article titled \u201cWhy Professor Dumpster\u2019s Gimmicks are a Bunch of Trash:\u201d\nThe new social experiment or whatever that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin \u2014 pretty self explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime \u2014 right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nYes, Professor Dumpster is going couchsurfing. (Hat tip to Billfold commenter Josh for sending us the Texas Monthly link.) The Texas Monthly notes that he\u2019s also looking for project funding \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms\u201d \u2014 but when I follow the link to his 99 Nights ATX sponsor page it looks like he\u2019s actually looking for corporate sponsors, which probably has more to do with raising the profile of his experiment than crowdfunding his couchsurfing.\nHere\u2019s how 99 Nights ATX describes the project:\nJeff will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their inner spaces. Sarah Natsumi Moore, an established Austin photographer, will document the journey with her camera and Clara Bensen, a local writer, will compile short stories to accompany each home.\nWe will learn a lot about the former Professor Dumpster and his team by the people he chooses to stay with and the stories his team chooses to tell about them.\nAfter all, it\u2019s pretty clear what story I\u2019m choosing to tell about Professor Dumpster.\nPhoto credit: PhotoAtelier\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\nDistraction-free reading.

Eventually, he hopes to turn his new home into a full-on \u201cspace capsule in a trash can\u201d with WiFi, air conditioning, an Xbox and other modern luxuries. The yearlong class experiment, called The Dumpster Project, is out to prove that people can live in a lot less space but still have a rich\u2014if not richer\u2014life.\nWho did you consult with for the project?\nI recruited a world-class team that includes one of the top green designers in the world, one of the top water energy experts and people in the STEM education community. They\u2019re acting as an advisory board. But the students do the real design and thought-process work on this.\nWhy a dumpster and not some other small space?\nYou get a very shocking reaction when you tell people at a cocktail party that you\u2019re living in a dumpster. They don\u2019t say, \u201cThat\u2019s great. The weather tomorrow looks terrible.\u201d The experiment fuels a very long conversation within and between groups that don\u2019t traditionally talk about issues of living with less and sustainability.\nAny thoughts on how this will affect your personal life?\nMy mom is a Martha Stewart\u2013type and very concerned about image. If someone brings it up at her bridge club, it pokes her a little bit, but I think she secretly likes it. My girlfriend has always known [about the project]. I think once I actually move in, it will become difficult. I\u2019m on campus, so there are visitation hours.\nWill you be entertaining in your new place?\nOh yeah. We\u2019re going to have a dumpster-warming party when I move in. I want to have a couple of chairs out in the yard and a little back porch. It\u2019s one of the best views in Austin. A thousand-dollar home with a million-dollar view.\nPopular Articles\nWhy Is Austin Dating So Cursed?\nA Major Developer\u2019s Collapse Leaves Abandoned Projects Scattered Across Austin\nThe 25 Best Tacos in Austin\n50 Great Dates in Austin\n6 Texas Beaches Just a Short Drive From Austin\nWhat\u2019s With All These Breakups in Austin?\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nCurrent Issue\nArchives\nTRENDING NOW\n1907\u2019s Chill Summer, and Other Austin Weather Records That Might Surprise You\nThe Highland Lakes Are Rising Again!

Solutions.\nGrist home\nFollow\nDonate\nThis nutty professor lives in a dumpster\nJeff Wilson has moved into a 33-square-foot trash container in an effort to create a \"low-impact, zero-net-waste\" life.\nInhabitat Blog\nBrentin Mock\nPublished\nSep 11, 2014\nTopic\nClimate + Culture\nShare/Republish\nCopy Link\nRepublish\nI stumbled upon James Hamblin\u2019s profile of Jeff Wilson, a.k.a. \u201cProfessor Dumpster,\u201d in The Atlantic. Wilson, college dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is highlighted for his daring challenge to live inside of a 33-square-foot trash container. It\u2019s all part of the Dumpster Project, an experiment he\u2019s developing with students to build a \u201clow-impact, zero-net-waste\u201d dwelling out of the trash container.\nIt was interesting to learn about how many items of convenience Wilson has stripped from his life to place himself basically in solitary confinement: He\u2019s got no toilet or shower (he uses the university\u2019s), no washer and dryer for his clothes (he uses the laundromat), and his wardrobe is reduced to a few pairs of pants and shirts, three hats, and \u201ceight or nine\u201d bowties.\nIt\u2019s basically a crib \u2014 though when finally complete, it will be something that could possibly revive MTV Cribs. Here\u2019s what it will look like:\n  This was not mentioned in the story, but his school, Huston-Tillotson, is a historically black university. The student group Hamblin does mention, Green is the New Black, is the Huston-Tillotson student organization that is driving the Dumpster Project, and it is holding its inaugural Building Green Justice Forum on campus on Sept. 25.\nHuston-Tillotson is spotlighted in the a report I just wrote about that highlights environmental work and progress at historically black schools. In particular Huston-Tillotson gets props for its Dumpster 101 curriculum, based on this project, and also its off-campus activity, like the STEM program it\u2019s created for K-12 classes. It\u2019s kinda criminal that this university didn\u2019t make the Sierra Club\u2019s or Princeton\u2019s \u201cgreenest schools\u201d lists based on this dumpster-ology alone.\nWhich brings me to another item left out of the story: That East Austin, where Wilson\u2019s dumpster home and the university are located, is an area where African Americans and Latinos have historically lived segregated from the rest of the city. This racial segregation is by design, which you can read about in Cecilia Balli\u2019s Texas Monthly story, or Luke Winkie\u2019s in Vice. It\u2019s part of why Austin is considered the 10th most segregated city in the nation.\nEast Austin is showing signs of gentrification, however. And Wilson himself could be easily taken for one of those caricatured-too-much hipsters encroaching upon black territory. He\u2019s white. He has \u201ceight or nine bowties.\u201d But his Dumpster story charts a different path.\nThe lack of space in Wilson\u2019s pod has pushed him into more intimate contact with his neighbors. As noted in the story:\nHe spent a lot more time out in the community, just walking around. \u201cI almost feel like East Austin is my home and backyard,\u201c he said. He is constantly thinking about what sorts of things a person really needs in a house, and what can be more communal.\n\u201cWhat if everybody had to go to some sort of laundromat?\u201d Wilson posited. \u201cHow would that shift how we have to, or get to, interact with others? I know I have met a much wider circle of people just from going to laundromats and wandering around outside of the dumpster when I would\u2019ve been in there if I had a large flat screen and a La-Z Boy.\u201d \u2026\nHe\u2019s also welcoming of anyone who wants to stop by the dumpster and talk sustainability any time. \u2026 On some nights, Wilson will stay with a friend, and students from the ecology-focused campus group Green Is the New Black will get a night to stay in the dumpster.\nOne of the biggest gripes about gentrification is that the invasive species moving in often seclude themselves from the natives, throwing off community chemistry. But Wilson\u2019s dumpster is not a white sanctuary among black residents. Community is part of his intention. Also, since his place of rest is not a house, his occupation has not lead to someone else\u2019s displacement, another prime feature of gentrification.\nNow obviously we can\u2019t all live in dumpsters to avoid pushing people out of their homes. But I like the kind of thinking that Wilson\u2019s dumpster model hopefully inspires: How can we get in front of the problems often created in the gentrifying process? One way is not to ignore race, but rather to purposefully engage  it.\nA message from   \nAll donations matched for a limited time!\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

(Courtesy of Jeff Wilson)\nBy Peter Holley\nMarch 2, 2015 at 12:40 p.m. EST\nJeff Wilson\u2019s life had all the trappings of a conventional adult existence.\nFor starters, he was living in a comfortable, 3,000-square-foot Brownsville, Tex., home with a large walk-in closet, an easily accessible bathroom and a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. He had a tenure-track professorship at a state university, an hour-long commute and a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\n\nToday, Wilson has none of those things \u2014 and insists that he\u2019s never been happier.\nBetween then and now, there was a divorce, a new job in a new city, a surrendering of worldly possessions, a new social arrangement with a new romantic partner and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 an olive green dumpster that he called home.\nUntil he vacated it last month, Wilson \u2014 an associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin \u2014 spent an entire year living in a converted trash receptacle on the historically black college campus.\nAdvertisement\nOn its face, turning the 33-square-foot space into a livable home \u2014 complete with an AC unit, a weather station, a mailbox, and a false-floor basement to store cooking equipment and clothes  \u2014 was a bold exercise in sustainability that demonstrated a person\u2019s ability to comfortably exist in a space 1 percent the size of the average American household.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an insane idea on the surface, and it may be an insane idea below the surface,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cAs a way of having a better life, I decided to move into a dumpster.\u201d\n[Why being too busy makes us feel so good]\nWilson said the immediate benefits of living in the container were myriad: Lower rent, lower utility payments, less time spent doing chores, a shorter commute (approximately 90 seconds on foot) and less money spent on unnecessary possessions. Those benefits may sound underwhelming compared to the sacrifice involved, but in totality, Wilson said, they offered a new freedom.\nBecause his living space was so small, Wilson said he also spent much less time at home. Instead, he was frequently on and around campus, having face-to-face interactions. (Importantly, he also had to leave the dumpster to use the restroom or take showers, which he did at the campus gymnasium.) As the boundaries between home and community blurred, the neighborhood surrounding the university began to feel like an extension of his backyard.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere are all these studies that say the broader and deeper your social network is, not only does it create more happiness, but it increases your life span,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIn the modern home you can have a cradle to grave experience. Your doula can pop you out in the living room, you can get an MIT education online, order food from outside and then work from home until you die in the living room watching your flat screen TV.\u201d\n[Shipping container time-lapse: Watch an apartment go up in 3 days]\nAdjusting to the dumpster lifestyle also forced Wilson to give away almost everything he owned, he said. At his most spartan, he owned four pants, four shirts (two short-sleeve and two long-sleeve), three pairs of shoes, three hats and eight or nine bowties, according to the SpareFoot Blog.\nAmong the few possessions he did purchase during his year in the dumpster were a garden gnome and a small air conditioning unit to offset the blazing summer heat, which reached as high as 130 degrees inside the dumpster during the hottest parts of the day.\n\u201cI gave away a pair of shoes last week\u2014it\u2019s almost a bit like an addiction,\u201d Wilson said in August. \u201cI think I\u2019ve crossed the point of crazy into insanity and just keep reducing the amount of stuff I have.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBut as \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d (as he is now known) readjusts to a more demanding lifestyle \u2014 moving in with his girlfriend, paying higher bills and dealing with the demands that exist outside the confines of the dumpster \u2014 he has come to realize that the last year was also an experiment in reducing \u201cnoise.\u201d\nNot necessarily the audible kind, he said, but the kind of noise that arrives in the form of endless e-mails and tasks and responsibilities and the sort of informational overload that has spawned the \u201cdigital detox\u201d movement.\n[5 stupidly easy, science-based resolutions for people who spend too much time online]\nSome noise is unavoidable, Wilson notes \u2014 unless, of course, you want to quit your job and relocate to a dumpster. The professor maintains that modern noise is not the problem so much as the mental fatigue it creates. That fatigue, he argues, is what keeps many people from focusing on the activities or passions that lead to more meaning and purpose in their lives.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be aware enough to watch for meaning if you\u2019re buried in e-mails or facing a barrage of direct messages on Twitter,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the bandwidth or the time or the attention to watch. You\u2019re looking, but watching is a different exercise.\u201d\nShare this article\nAfter separating from his wife in 2010, Wilson was the one searching for greater purpose in his life. He could continue writing papers, teaching his classes and following a traditional academic path, but he wanted something more, he recalled. What that something was, he couldn\u2019t exactly say.\n[Overwhelmed: A busy working mother tries to figure out where all her time is going]\nHis epiphany arrived in the most mundane way imaginable. He was working on a peer-reviewed paper in his office, a cup of espresso in one hand and a pen in the other.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI looked out into the parking lot, and this gate was opening,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone was about to throw something into the dumpster and I said, \u2018Man that\u2019s it. I need to move into one of these guys.'\u201d\nThat\u2019s it?\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said.\nIt would take almost two more years to make the move. In the summer of 2013, he landed a new job in Austin, where Wilson figured his idea would get more traction. The plan was first broached with his provost over a lunch a week after he was hired, he said.\n\u201cI told her I wanted to live on a corner of campus in a trash dumpster and turn it into a tiny sustainable home,\u201d Wilson recalled. \u201cIt was crickets for an unimaginable amount of time and finally she said she needed to talk to the university\u2019s president about it.\u201d\nWhen Wilson told his students about \u201cThe Dumpster Project,\u201d there was silence.\nAdvertisement\nThen, there was laughter.\nFor most people, Wilson said, reducing noise can begin incrementally and doesn\u2019t require moving into a cramped container. Start by finding ways to reduce your e-mail load so you can spend more time with your children, he said. If you downsize your home, you might be able to live in a smaller place closer to work to cut down on your commute time.\n\u201cThe average American has 12 pairs of shoes and the average American house is 2480-square-feet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can happily live with much less than that.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s this idea you have to go find a guru in India and sit on a mountain top in the Himalayas to go through a transformation. But you can continue to perform in your job and make changes in your life that will help you find more meaning.\u201d\n[Stressed? Try checking your e-mail less]\nFor now, the dumpster will remain on campus to serve as an educational tool for students, artists and educators, who can tour the home or spend a few nights inside. The hope, Wilson said, is that someday he\u2019ll be able to take his old dumpster on the road. He also wants to write a book about his year in the dumpster and the lessons learned inside.\nNext for Professor Dumpster: A project called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d in which Wilson pledges to spend 99 nights couch-surfing in Austin to learn about the different ways people are living as the city booms in size. Another experiment \u2014 this one involving traveling to eight countries over 21 days with a woman he\u2019d recently met on OkCupid \u2014 went viral and led to a movie deal for his travel companion.\nAdvertisement\nWilson also hopes to expand his original dumpster to include multiple levels, as well as a bathroom, deck and vegetable garden.\n[Some aging Baby Boomers will upsize, not downsize, if they move at all, poll finds]\nThe transition into the dumpster was difficult, Wilson recalled, with the temperature dropping below 30 degrees multiple times during that first week. And yet, he said, the transition out of the dumpster has been even harder.\nHe cried, he said, the day he moved out.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the difficulty of moving out was the attachment I formed to it as a home,\u201d he said, \u201cor if it was anticipation of more noise entering my life.\u201d\n[Billy the Kid\u2019s former hideout is on the market, and it\u2019s adorably charming]\nShare\nNEWSLETTER\nAS NEWS BREAKS\nExclusive Alerts\nBreaking news email alerts and investigative journalism you'll only find in The Post.\nSign up\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nCompany\nAbout The Post\nNewsroom Policies & Standards\nDiversity & Inclusion\nCareers\nMedia & Community Relations\nWP Creative Group\nAccessibility Statement\nSitemap\nGet The Post\nBecome a Subscriber\nGift Subscriptions\nMobile & Apps\nNewsletters & Alerts\nWashington Post Live\nReprints & Permissions\nPost Store\nBooks & E-Books\nToday\u2019s Paper\nPublic Notices\nContact Us\nContact the Newsroom\nContact Customer Care\nContact the Opinions Team\nAdvertise\nLicensing & Syndication\nRequest a Correction\nSend a News Tip\nReport a Vulnerability\nTerms of Use\nDigital Products Terms of Sale\nPrint Products Terms of Sale\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Settings\nSubmissions & Discussion Policy\nRSS Terms of Service\nAd Choices\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post",

Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the 'new 1%' will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home,\" reads The Dumpster Project website.\nWe first came across Wilson over at The Atlantic, where they describe his downsizing from a 2,500-square-foot house to a 500-square-foot apartment and finally to the 36-square-foot dumpster. For reference, that's 152 square feet less than the self-proclaimed \"world's smallest house\" in London, 204 square feet less than a typical $30,000 tiny house, and 92 square feet smaller than the tiny house in which a Business Insider reporter spent the weekend with her mom.\nAdvertisement\nWe were so intrigued by Wilson's project that we reached out to Team Dumpster to see if it had photos to share. We've published them here with the group's permission.\nAdvertisement\nThe Dumpster Project will be completed in three phases, starting when Wilson took occupancy in February 2014: camping in a bare-bones dumpster (shown here); living in a dumpster \"home,\" with additions such as storage and a bed; and then fine-tuning the dumpster into the ultimate sustainable home.\nSarah Natsumi Moore / The Dumpster Project\nEarlier in stage two, the project's current stage, a fake floor was installed to store Wilson's belongings and limited wardrobe.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nLater in this stage, the dumpster will be hooked up to electricity and water.

This is relevant to the story only because New Line Cinema bought the rights to turn that story into a rom-com.\nIn 2014, Wilson moved into a dumpster behind the women\u2019s dormitory at Huston-Tillotson University in East Austin. Over the past year, Wilson converted the dumpster into a tiny home, complete with air conditioning \u2014 it is Austin, after all \u2014 as well as the full support of the university where he is both professor and dean of the University College. A student group, Green Is the New Black, helped him with his project and slept in the dumpster on nights when Wilson elected to sleep elsewhere.\nThis is where people, including me, begin to project their own emotions onto the story: why did he pick the dumpster behind the women\u2019s dorm? Why do I feel weird about students sleeping over in their professor\u2019s living space, even if he isn\u2019t there? How does Wilson balance dumpster life with parenting his elementary-school-aged daughter? (Wilson is divorced and it appears that his ex-wife has primary custody of their daughter.)\nAnd here\u2019s one new emotion that I just picked up this morning: why did none of the Professor Dumpster articles that I read over the past year, not until the Washington Post profile I read today, mention that Huston-Tillotson University is an Historically Black College? If there are students of color who helped Professor Dumpster build his dumpster house, their faces should have been photographed next to his, alongside his bow tie and his Stetson.\nBut we don\u2019t have to worry about any of that anymore, because Professor Dumpster is moving out of the dumpster \u2014 and if you live in Austin, he might be coming to a couch near you.\nAs the Texas Monthly reports, in an article titled \u201cWhy Professor Dumpster\u2019s Gimmicks are a Bunch of Trash:\u201d\nThe new social experiment or whatever that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin \u2014 pretty self explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime \u2014 right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nYes, Professor Dumpster is going couchsurfing. (Hat tip to Billfold commenter Josh for sending us the Texas Monthly link.) The Texas Monthly notes that he\u2019s also looking for project funding \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms\u201d \u2014 but when I follow the link to his 99 Nights ATX sponsor page it looks like he\u2019s actually looking for corporate sponsors, which probably has more to do with raising the profile of his experiment than crowdfunding his couchsurfing.\nHere\u2019s how 99 Nights ATX describes the project:\nJeff will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their inner spaces. Sarah Natsumi Moore, an established Austin photographer, will document the journey with her camera and Clara Bensen, a local writer, will compile short stories to accompany each home.\nWe will learn a lot about the former Professor Dumpster and his team by the people he chooses to stay with and the stories his team chooses to tell about them.\nAfter all, it\u2019s pretty clear what story I\u2019m choosing to tell about Professor Dumpster.\nPhoto credit: PhotoAtelier\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\nDistraction-free reading.

This is a question best pondered, it seems, from the inside of a Dumpster \u2013 which is why Jeff Wilson, a dean and associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, decided to move into one this past February. It seemed the perfect testing ground for the theory that \"less is more.\" Wilson intends to stay there one year, during which time \u2013 assuming all goes well with a $100,000 Kickstarter campaign ending July 1 \u2013 he and students will transform the Dumpster into a \"sustainable house and interactive teaching lab\" that uses only \"1% of the water, energy, and space of the average American home.\" As Wilson likes to say, \"It's the new one percent.\"\nAccording to the current design proposal on Kickstarter, the Dumpster's final stage of transformation (\"Phase 3: Space Capsule \u00dcber Dumpster\") will feature a \"pop-up\" second story, sleeping loft, \"folding balcony,\" composting toilet, solar shower, and rooftop rain collection system. For portability, it will tuck back together into its original form like George Jetson's briefcase. The whole experiment will be accessible \"in real time\" thanks to \"dumpster cams and a data feed with current dumpster conditions.\"\nFinal plans for a livable Dumpster (Image courtesy of Jeff Wilson)\nCurrent Dumpster conditions for now are more modest and mosquito-ridden \u2013 though, as Wilson notes, \"What's nice about a 33-square-foot house is you can just net the whole thing.\" While he's become adept at leaping through the Dumpster's side window, he provides guests with a repurposed swimming-pool ladder. Inside, all appears clean, thanks to a vigorous run through a \"car wash on steroids\" at the Texas Disposal Systems' facility. None\u00adthe\u00adless, says Wilson, \"My girlfriend swears she can still smell a hint of barbecue. Maybe we got lucky and got a Dumpster from behind Franklin's Bar\u00adbecue.\" Art by Wilson's 6-year-old daughter adorns the walls, solar-powered gadgets charge his iPhone and track indoor temperature, and raised floor panels hide clothes stored underneath. At night, he sleeps on a Kazakh mat. Being an inch taller than the Dumpster is wide, he lies diagonally across the six-by-six-foot space (along the hypotenuse, in professor language). In the mornings, he makes Turkish coffee and tends his garden with water lugged by foot from Lady Bird Lake.\nThere is also a considerable element of theatre. Notably, Wilson does these things while donning the role of his bespectacled, bow tie-clad alter ego, \"Professor Dump\u00adster.\" With an affinity for pithy bons mots and puns (his email signature is \"at your disposal\"), Wilson has infused the project with a winking irreverence. His move-in during February's long cold spell drew news coverage from as far away as the UK, which suggests that the Dumpster is precisely the \"conversation box\" it's intended to be. The Professor also appeals to students. In the spring, Blackshear Ele\u00adment\u00adary School fifth graders joined in to test soil, filter water, and build garden beds. At year's end, Professor Dumpster spoke at the students' graduation. This kind of hands-on learning is particularly meaningful, says Blackshear Principal Betty Jen\u00adkins, and it builds much-needed college awareness.\nAmanda Masino, an HT assistant professor of biology, helps develop \"experiential, design-based, and inquiry-based\" curricula around the project, using \"the same challenge but modifying it based on grade level,\" she says. A Dumpster 101 class brings HT students into the project, which is generating lessons beyond simply tracking energy and water use. Students will be analyzing DNA swabbed from the Dump\u00adster's interior, for example, and sampling Wilson's blood to track his stress levels. There are also policy issues to be explored, such as the limits building codes impose on design.\nThe project has significance for students beyond the classroom. Last fall, they thought it was \"strange\" when Wilson proposed living in a Dumpster, says sophomore Angelica Erazo, but they rallied around the sustainability idea. \"We decided to come up with an organization to help push that issue, as well as create environmental awareness in the Eastside community,\" she says. Erazo co-founded Green Is the New Black, a student group promoting a campuswide initiative to reduce water and energy use. The organization recently won $10,000 from Home Depot in the Retool Your School challenge. The group is also focused on bringing minorities into the environmental conversations of which, Erazo notes, they've often been left out. Because affordability is a major part of that conversation for low-income communities, she hopes to clear up the misconception that being environmentally friendly has to be expensive. \"You can save money being green,\" she says, pointing to simple behaviors like turning off the lights.\nThe Dumpster Project is not one of those money-saving endeavors \u2013 at least not yet. While the point right now is to bring the brightest designers and best technological expertise to the experiment, says Wilson, affordability is central to the ultimate goal of developing a sustainable model of living. \"This may be a $100,000 Dumpster home,\" says Wilson, \"but the next project might be the tiniest house built to code, and the next could be a tiny home for under $20,000.\"\nGot something to say on the subject?

He\u2019s an environmental science professor at Huston-Tillotson University (HTU) AND a dean!\nI had to meet him when I flew into Austin for a board meeting earlier this month.\nWhat\u2019s his story?\nHe\u2019s the test variable in his own research, exploring the boundaries of conventional living options.\nCan one live in a space of 36-square feet?\nThe first half of the year, he endured sparse amenities, sponge baths at a sink in one of the university\u2019s bathrooms, and sub-freezing nights. The second half of the year, he added some creature comforts with air conditioning and a futon bed.\nAs a professor, he inspires by example. His students remain curious about sustainability in their own lives. He welcomes teachers to spend a night through his Dumpster Project \u201cHome\u201d School residency program. (Scroll to \u201cEducation Programs\u201d in the PDF that opens.) His DumpterProject.org even offers educational opportunities for 5th and 7th grade science\u2014helping young people understand sustainability of water, food, and energy.\nWhat unfolded was quite unexpected.\nWe met for breakfast on a rainy morning at a small neighborhood restaurant two miles east of the Capitol.\nDonning a professorial corduroy sport coat over a plaid shirt with bowtie, and heavy black-framed glasses topped with a Stetson will catch anyone\u2019s attention!  That adventurous mix caught mine.\nHe is letting go.\nHe picked up the tab for breakfast. I objected since I had invited him to meet with me. He explained that\u2019s what the money is for\u2014to let it go. Although, he\u2019s not giving away money, he is testing many of the conventions of day-to-day living we often take for granted.\nHe just sold his car the evening before we met, choosing to get around town on an electric bicycle or on foot.\nAfter breakfast, we walked to the University to see the Dumpster. I looked inside and took a few pictures. (It had just been painted.) We went to his office to continue our discussion.\nWhat is he trying to prove?\nHe\u2019s asked this question, frequently. Anytime, anyone endeavors to do something that defies convention, amateur psychologists gather to decode the pioneer\u2019s psyche by delving into the past.\nWas it something from his childhood?\n I was curious about his childhood. He recalls trying to arrange Legos in ways that reflect principles of feng shui. He remembers most horizontal surfaces filled with stuff. In STUFFology 101, there\u2019s a reference to tilting horizontal surfaces to prevent the accumulation of POOP (Piles of Overwhelming Paperwork).\nA past relationship?\nHe was married once, but his ex-wife\u2019s and his relationship went their separate ways, amicably.\nPast profession?\nAfter a stint with Ernst & Young, he quit, because in the real world, it seems no matter how stellar one\u2019s results, there\u2019s always a leader wants things done a certain way.\nSometimes, people do things for reasons we\u2019re unable to understand.\nHe\u2019s not trying to change our behavior.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to do anything.\u201d He doesn\u2019t expect the world\u2019s population to live in dumpsters. Although, a dumpster would be desirable shelter for billions who live in poverty.\nHe\u2019s not even trying to prove a point.\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing my own thing.\u201d He\u2019s stretching the boundaries of how we choose to live while exploring sustainable options. He\u2019s conducting \u201cradical personal experiments that have the potential to make a ripple in society.\u201d He\u2019s \u201cinspired by people who sell their home, buy an RV, and travel. It\u2019s a freeing feeling.\u201d\nWhy a Dumpster?\n\u201cThe dumpster is a metaphor for the dichotomy between our sacred space (where we live) and the waste we throw away. The crap we don\u2019t want disappears when we toss it in a dumpster.\u201d Bringing together such disparate elements \u201cserves as a symbol and a surprise.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next?\nHis goal is to explore \u201chow to build a beautiful home for the price of a car payment in the middle of a city.\u201d\nHis research is inspiring. His experiments are lessons in letting go while letting in the world of adventure through sustainable living. He inspires a growing community of us with greater awareness of the cumulative global impact of our feature-rich lifestyles.\nBy letting go of things we often think are necessary, he has created a life of freedom, flexibility, and fun. For example, he and his girlfriend/writer, Clara Bensen, completed several trips to different countries around the world without any baggage. Read more on his Wikipedia page.\nI hope he doesn\u2019t let go of the gift of STUFFology 101: Get Your Mind out of the Clutter, I was happy to sign for him.\n  Tags: Letting go, piles of overwhelming paperwork, POOP, Professor Dumpster, STUFFology 101 book\nYou might also like\n1\nREPLY\nEric Riddle STUFFologist\nApril 23, 2015 at 8:56 am\nWow, talk about letting go of stuff!\nThere is some pretty cool information as you click through the various links. I liked the video overview of The Dumpster Project, very matter of fact approach. For me it is compelling because he does not preach, but just explains what he is doing and offers examples of possible benefits of his research project.\nIt definitely makes me consider how much less stuff I can live with!\nComments are closed.\nRECENT POSTS\nThe Future of STUFFology 101\nDo Something In 2022\nWe NEED Your HELP \u2013 Please Read and Comment\nUnexpected Gifts for Christmas\nDeclutter Tug-of-War with Past, Present, and Future\nRECENT COMMENTS\nMiguel Mayorga on Declutter Tug-of-War with Past, Present, and Future\nEric Riddle STUFFologist on Nostalgia\u2014Fondness for Times Past\nLeslie A Boyle on Nostalgia\u2014Fondness for Times Past\nBrenda Avadian on Kids, Cats, and Clutter\nBrenda Avadian STUFFologist on \u201cWhen I get rid of this stuff, then I will\u2026 \u201c\nARCHIVES\nJanuary 2022\nDecember 2021\nNovember 2021\nOctober 2021\nSeptember 2021\nAugust 2021\nJuly 2021\nJune 2021\nMay 2021\nApril 2021\nMarch 2021\nFebruary 2021\nJanuary 2021\nDecember 2020\nNovember 2020\nJanuary 2019\nDecember 2016\nApril 2016\nFebruary 2016\nNovember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nAugust 2015\nJuly 2015\nJune 2015\nMay 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nJanuary 2015\nDecember 2014\nNovember 2014\nAugust 2014\nJune 2014\nApril 2014\nMarch 2014\nCATEGORIES\n2 Magic Questions\nCluttergories\nDe-Clutter\nDigital Stuff\nFUN Stuff\nNews 'n Views\nReviews\nS.T.U.F.F.\nUnexpected Gifts",

For \u201cThe Ultimate Conversation Box: A Dumpster,\u201d Dr. Wilson will be describing how he links his academic research, teaching, and community activism with issues of sustainability as well as with his role as a dean at Huston-Tillotson University. Wilson will also give a \u201ctour\u201d of his dumpster/home.\nHere\u2019s what a recent piece in The Atlantic had to say about him:\nProfessor Wilson went to the dumpster not just because he wished to live deliberately, and not just to teach his students about the environmental impacts of day-to-day life, and not just to gradually transform the dumpster into \u201cthe most thoughtfully-designed, tiniest home ever constructed.\u201d Wilson\u2019s reasons are a tapestry of these things.\n[\u2026]\nNot long ago, Wilson was nesting in a 2,500 square foot house. After going through a divorce (\u201cnothing related to the dumpster,\u201d he told me, unsolicited), he spun into the archetypal downsizing of a newly minted bachelor. He moved into a 500-square-foot apartment. Then he began selling clothes and furniture on Facebook for almost nothing. Now he says almost everything he owns is in his 36-square-foot dumpster, which is sanctioned and supported by the university as part of an ongoing sustainability-focused experiment called The Dumpster Project. \u201cWe could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson said at the launch, \u201c[fueled by] sunlight and surface water, and people could have a pretty good life.\u201d\n[\u2026]\nFor Professor Dumpster, the undertaking is at once grand and diminutive, selfless and introspective, silly and gravely important, even dark. \u201cWe bring everything into the home these days,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to leave the home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home.\u201d\n\u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\nThe talk will take place Friday, September 26 at 4:30 in Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s AL Auditorium at 900 Chicon Street.\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Department of American Studies, the Graduate Program in Community and Regional Planning, and Plan II Honors. We hope to see you there.\nShare:\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\nLoading...\nRelated\nPost-Game Analysis: Senior Cole Wilson on Dr. Chris Newfield and the Future of Higher Education\nMay 6, 2016\nIn \"public scholarship\"\nAnnouncement: Dr. Julia Mickenberg Comments on Civil Rights History in Life and Letters\nApril 8, 2014\nIn \"Announcements\"\nFive Questions with First Years Continues: An Interview with Kristen Wilson\nOctober 29, 2018\nThis entry was posted in Announcements and tagged activism, Austin, dumpster, environment, HBCU, sustainability.\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Announcement: Deborah Willis Lecture This Thursday\nAlumni Voices: Carly Kocurek \u2192\nLeave a comment\nAMS :: ATX is a blog dedicated to representing the many activities and interests of the department of American Studies at The University of Texas at Austin.

An environmental science professor is making a 33-square-foot dumpster his new home for the next year.\nHis name is Dr. Jeff Wilson, but since embarking on this journey, he's now going by Professor Dumpster.\nHe teaches at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, and received his Ph.D. from Harvard.\nThe goal is to embrace energy efficiency, and to prove that it is possible to live on a smaller scale - a much smaller scale.\nThis whole project revolves around using one percent of what an average American uses: one percent of the water, energy and waste.\nDr. Jeff Wilson checks out his new 33 square foot dumpster home. (Credit: @profdumpster/Instagram)\n\"We really needed some sort of excitement around science, sustainability and technology,\" says Wilson.\nHe says the idea came to him over two years ago. Since then he's been recruiting a world-class team of professors, scientists and environmentalists to make his idea a reality.\n\"My hypothesis is that my life will be better,\" Wilson says. \"I'll be fulfilling a richer life by living a smaller life.\"\nLast night was the first night in his new home. Wilson says that in this phase of the project, the only thing he has to keep him warm during the cold Texas nights is his sleeping bag.\nHe's embracing the simplicity, and welcoming the changes that will come in the next year of the project. Instead of being strapped down to expensive monthly rent, he'll be a homeowner with his mortgage paid off.\nBut dumpster living comes with challenges, like walking a mile down the hill to the town lake for water.\nThe outlook is positive, though. Wilson says in six months he hopes to have things like an air conditioner and an X-box. A shower, a toilet and even WiFi is in the works, too.\nDr. Wilson has a whole team behind him, including a student organization called Green is the New Black. He says team members can even volunteer to spend the night in the dumpster and give him the night off. As the project progresses, the team will be fundraising for low-energy appliances and electronics, and will monitor the energy used on the team's blog.\nHe'll be taking his dumpster home to local elementary schools and sharing his project with the students. It gives the students the opportunity to give him design ideas and ask questions. One of the most pressing so far: \"How is Santa going to get in?\"\nTo follow Dr. Wilson and his team's journey through dumpster living, check out the blog at dumpsterproject.org.\nABC News Network Privacy Policy Your US State Privacy Rights Children's Online Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads Terms of Use Do Not Sell My Info Contact Us \u00a9 2024 ABC News Internet Ventures.

Don\u2019t they know that goes in the recycling?\nWilson is one of those energetic college professors who students will remember for the rest of their lives, thanks to his imagination and creativity. Along with thinking outside the box, he\u2019ll be living in it. Truth is, students retain what their entertaining teachers tell them.\n\u201cNobody wants to hear another lecture about how the world is going to be destroyed if everybody doesn\u2019t drive a Prius,\u201d said Wilson, a seventh-generation Texan who did his postdoctoral work at Harvard University. \u201cWhat we want to do is have a party and have everybody come to the party.\u201d\nThe point of the dumpster experiment is to show that people can live with less. Wilson points out that he will be staying in a space that is a mere 1 percent the size of an average American home.\nSome of Wilson\u2019s students formed a group called Green Is The New Black and won a green-oriented student competition in Dearborn, Mich., that landed Huston-Tillotson a $75,000 grant from the Ford Foundation. Most of the money will be used for scholarships, but $20,000 of it will go to Professor Dumpster\u2019s Dumpster Project, dumpsterproject.org.\nThe dumpster, which Wilson hopes to move into by February, will be cozy. When ready, it will be set up on a concrete slab poured for the project on the Huston-Tillotson campus, at East Seventh and Chicon streets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the same size as this booth, maybe a little bit smaller,\u201d Wilson said, as we ate lunch in a restaurant near downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s six by six.\u201d Forget about stretching out. \u201cI\u2019ll fit in there at an angle,\u201d Wilson added. Actually, the Dumpster Project will use two dumpsters provided by Texas Disposal Systems \u2014 one for Wilson\u2019s living arrangements and one to conduct environmental experiments in Wilson\u2019s Dumpster 101 lab.\n\u201cSomebody said it was a cross between Bill Nye (the Science Guy), Thoreau and Oscar the Grouch,\u201d Wilson said.\nWilson\u2019s students are pumped. \u201cI think he deserves some sort of plaque or something,\u201d said Olivia Sanchez, a Huston-Tillotson senior majoring in biology with a concentration on environmental science.\nWilson\u2019s year in a dumpster will run through various stages.\nDuring the first stage, Wilson will rough it. \u201cDumpster camping,\u201d he calls it. It will be him and four metal walls, and that\u2019s it. Although he will have the dumpster scrubbed for nasties before he climbs in the side door. The dumpster cleaning will provide another teaching opportunity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to show the kids blown-up microscopic images of what was in the dumpster before Professor Dumpster moved into it as a home,\u201d he said.\nHey Doc, what\u2019s for lunch?\n\u201cI want to do an urban forage and not buy anything at H-E-B,\u201d said Professor Dumpster, who plans to do a bit of dumpster diving during the early going.\nAs time goes on, the dumpster will be tricked out with some of the amenities of a middle-class home. Wilson plans to install a solar panel, a little composting toilet, even a shower behind the Dumpster. \u201cAll of the stuff to make it a normal American home instead of a trash can,\u201d Wilson said.\n\u201cI was trying to get a Sleep Number bed,\u201d he added. But when he walked into a mattress store to inquire, he discovered that wouldn\u2019t happen. \u201cThere was a long pause, and they said, \u2018No, we don\u2019t make dumpster home mattresses.\u2019\u201d\nWilson, who will get his water in a bucket from Lady Bird Lake, wants to involve the campus in the project. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get the track team to help me bring up the water from Lady Bird Lake as a track exercise,\u201d he said.\nWilson doesn\u2019t look like a ladies\u2019 man. He\u2019s got nerd written all over him. He wears a bowtie, an old Open Road Stetson like the one LBJ wore, black high-top Converse basketball shoes and thick-framed glasses. Still, he must be a charmer.\nWhen Wilson isn\u2019t dumpstering, he\u2019s visiting foreign countries \u2014 with no luggage. He met his girlfriend, Austin writer Clara Bensen, last year online through the OkCupid website. Then he convinced her to tour Europe with him \u2014 with no bags. Wilson and Bensen visited eight countries in 21 days with little but the clothes on their back.\nIf you can convince a woman to tour Europe without a bringing a bag the size of a circus tent, your persuasive abilities are spectacular.\n\u201cHer friends said, \u2018We don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy for going to Europe with no clothes. We just think you\u2019re crazy for going anywhere with Wilson,\u2019\u201d Wilson said.\nOK, so Bensen brought along one carry-on. \u201cShe took a purse, because she wanted to take two pairs of underwear,\u201d said Wilson, who brought only the underwear he was wearing.\nWilson explained the laundry regimen he recommends when you\u2019re traveling through Hungary, Turkey and Croatia with only a single pair of boxers.\n\u201cOn the first day, you wear your underwear under your jeans. On the second day, you go commando. And the third day, you wash clothes,\u201d he said. Is there a frat rat in America who isn\u2019t familiar with this routine? Except for the wash part.\nBy the way, Wilson doesn\u2019t figure his girlfriend will spend the year with him in his dumpster home.\n\u201cThere are visitation hours on campus, so my girlfriend can\u2019t stay overnight,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll appeal that.\u201d\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nAd\nLearn More\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

CNET Road Trip 2014 stopped by to see how the Dumpster Project could lead to healthier cities.\nDaniel Terdiman\nJuly 1, 2014 4:00 a.m. PT\n1 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nProf. Dumpster leaping\nAUSTIN, Texas -- In a world of dwindling resources, the average American lifestyle is almost certainly unsustainable. Yet most people don't have a model for how to live differently.\nThat's what Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, wants to provide. An environmental sciences professor and dean at Huston Tillotson University here, Professor Dumpster is in the middle of a project meant to prove it's possible to live super minimally, and super efficiently.\nFor a year, Professor Dumpster is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster -- outfitted, of course, for civilized living. But the goal is to do that living with zero waste, and extremely minimal use of power and water.\nAs part of Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman came to the Texas capital to see just how comfortable one can be living in a glorified trash can. Turns out, if you're willing to let go of a few creature comforts, it's not too bad.\nPlease click here to read my full story on the Dumpster Project.\n2 of 20\nDumpster Project\nDumpster Project Phase III drawing\nCurrently, the Dumpster Project is in Phase I, and Professor Dumpster and his team are actively trying to raise money to proceed to the next stages of the initiative.\nThis document shows what the project is intended to look like when it's much further along. With multiple stories, and a developed garden, this dumpster could be sophisticated living for the minimalist-inclined.\n3 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nProf. Dumpster laughing\nStanding inside the dumpster, located at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, laughs and enjoys his 33-square-foot home.\n4 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nPushing the water barrel\nIn its current state, the dumpster isn't connected to the grid in any way, which means that Professor Dumpster must get water the old-fashioned way -- by carrying it home. When he needs water, he pushes this water barrel, which holds 24 gallons, to Austin's Lady Bird Lake, an hour round-trip, where he fills it up. When he returns, he filters the water in order to make it potable.\n5 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nOn the phone\nThough the dumpster isn't connected to the grid, that doesn't mean Professor Dumpster is cut off from the world. He uses his iPhone to talk to people, and he spends much of the daylight hours at his university office, which is only a couple hundred yards away.\n6 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nHidden compartments\nAt first glance, you can't tell where Professor Dumpster keeps any of his clothes, bedding, or other important supplies. Then he opens a lid, revealing several hidden compartments under the floor.\n7 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nGarden\nOne element of the Dumpster Project is to grow a sustainable garden alongside the dumpster. Tended by Professor Dumpster and his students, the garden is turning out several kinds of vegetables.\n8 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nBaseline\nAs a way of demonstrating how much less energy and water he can live on than is used by the average American household, Professor Dumpster plans on installing a set of the average collection of household appliances next to the dumpster that he will use for a few months to establish an energy/water/waste consumption baseline. Then he will be able to compare his own usage to that of the baseline.\n9 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nIt's bigger on the inside\nAs an homage to Dr. Who and the Tardis, Professor Dumpster has a welcome mat outside the dumpster that reads \"It's bigger on the inside.\"\n10 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nCouchsurfing note\nProfessor Dumpster has not been the only one to live in the dumpster. Because it is a demonstration project, many others -- including his students -- have spent nights there. But he also opened up the dumpster to users of Couchsurfing.com, prompting this note from the first person to ever use that Web-based service to find a bed in a dumpster.\n11 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nLaying out bed pad\nBecause the dumpster's interior space is so small, Professor Dumpster must keep his bedding hidden away until he needs it. Here, he begins to set up the bed, first laying out his sleeping pad.\n12 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\n'Star Wars' sheets\nBefitting a geek like Professor Dumpster, he makes his bed using \"original\" \"Star Wars\" sheets.\n13 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nMosquito net\nTo attach a mosquito net, Professor Dumpster uses magnets that attach to the metal walls of the dumpster. He also uses magnets to attach many other things to the walls, including drawings by his daughter and other children.\n14 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nClimbing in\nProfessor Dumpster climbs inside his home.\n15 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nLooking in from the top\nThe top of the dumpster opens and closes, and when it rains, Professor Dumpster closes it.

On Monday, the project canceled its Kickstarter due to insufficient funding. They had been seeking $100,000, but received less than $16,000.\nThe project is planned out well into next year, including a wide range of expansion and educational initiatives. Professor Dumpster is now hoping people will donate funds directly through its Web site.\nMore Galleries\nMy Favorite Shots From the Galaxy S24 Ultra's Camera\nMy Favorite Shots From the Galaxy S24 Ultra's Camera\n20 PHOTOS\nHonor's Magic V2 Foldable Is Lighter Than Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra\nHonor's Magic V2 Foldable Is Lighter Than Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra\n10 PHOTOS\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus Looks Sweet in Aluminum\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus Looks Sweet in Aluminum\n23 PHOTOS\nSamsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra Now Has a Titanium Design\nSamsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra Now Has a Titanium Design\n23 PHOTOS\nI Took 600+ Photos With the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.

And On\nHe's leaving the Dumpster to a new, rotating cast of residents\nBY NORA ANKRUM, FRI., FEB. 6, 2015\nprint\nwrite a letter\n\nProfessor Dumpster in his element (Photo by John Anderson)\nHas it really been a year already? Apparently so, says Huston-Tillotson University College Dean Jeff Wilson, who on Tuesday night concluded his year-in-residence in Austin's most esteemed trash can. During the depths of last winter's cold spell, the biology professor moved into a Dumpster on the west side of HT's campus with little more than a sleeping bag and an iPhone for comfort. As an experiment in \"less is more\" living, the Dumpster Project was intended to test the limits of both sustainable design and sanity. In regard to the latter, says Wilson, \"I'm way happier than before I moved into the Dumpster.\"\nIt turns out that a 6-by-6-foot metal box makes an adequate cave for reading, napping, or getting away from it all. At the same time, says Wilson, \"you're just kind of forced to engage more, and I think that's a big part of why I'm happier.\" He notes that the low rent and \"minute-and-a-half\" commute to the office don't hurt either.\n\"We didn't make it to that sort of uber-Dumpster that we wanted,\" says Wilson. \"One of the lessons learned is that it's pretty damn hard to renovate your house when you're living in it.\" A composting toilet, pop-up balcony, and other experimental design elements went unrealized. Still, the project team planted gardens, installed data monitoring equipment, and got an air-conditioning unit (more important than a bathroom, discovered Wilson). Other additions are forthcoming as part of student-driven Brainstorm for the Box design challenges.\nWilson gave the Dumpster a fresh coat of paint last week in anticipation of its next guest, Blackshear Elementary School Principal Betty Jenkins, who planned to stay overnight Wednesday to kick off the Dump\u00adster Project \"Home\" School residency program. Other resident teachers will follow (students\u00ad can nominate a teacher at www.dumpsterproject.org/homeschool). All will return to the classroom with a Dumpster 101 curriculum developed in partnership with EcoRise and Blackshear, and piloted by the roughly 1,000 K-12 students who visited the Dumpster over the last year.\nWilson, meanwhile, is postponing a return to normalcy. Instead, he'll be spending 99 nights in different homes around town (e.g., mansion, high-rise condo, nursing home, under a bridge), all documented and photographed by his partner, writer Clara Benson, and photographer Sarah Natsumi Moore. \"There's such a real housing crisis in Austin,\" says Wilson. \"This doesn't go directly to the heart of that, but it sort of dances around it a bit.\" He hopes to explore the meaning of home and to \"gather a little bit of data\" along the way. \"It would've been a pretty big culture shock to move back into a real house,\" he says. \"I've got to kind of transition.\"\nVisit www.99nightsatx.com to follow Wilson's couch-surfing journey or to nominate a home where he should stay.\nGot something to say on the subject?

It\u2019s fun. It gets the wheels of imagination turning.\u201d\n3 Phases\nThe project will involve three phases of Dumpster living: a camping site; an average American (Dumpster) home; and a space-capsule design or \u00fcber Dumpster. At each stage, students from elementary school to college will pitch in to plan and test solutions for the abode. Experts will also offer advice.\nIn the first phase, \"Professor Dumpster\" (Wilson\u2019s nickname) will have a 15-degree-rated sleeping bag for camping in the trash can tent. (Temperatures in Austin have been in the 40s this week.) He will filter water for drinking from a nearby lake and use campus facilities for bathing.\nDuring the second phase, the Dumpster will be flashier, \u201cplugged into the electrical and water grid\u201d and feature appliances, such as a washing machine and dryer, according to project details.\nDumpster Project / Facebook\nUltimately, Wilson wants to answer this question: \u201cCan you have a pretty good life living in 1 percent of the average new American home with 1 percent the energy, 1 percent the water, and 1 percent the waste?\u201d\nIn the third phase, the student team will attempt to get one percent of the energy and water use of an average American home, all contained in the tiny container.\nAt the end of the project, Wilson hopes to answer this question: \u201cCan you have a pretty good life living in 1 percent of the average new American home with 1 percent the energy, 1 percent the water, and 1 percent the waste?\u201d\nThe Ford Foundation is donating $75,000 to the effort.\nExpert Advisor\nOthers have also tossed around the idea of Dumpster living.\nIn 2011, California artist Gregory Kloehn transformed a trash container into a fully functional home, equipped with a working kitchen, toilet, storage and sleeping area.\nKim Aronson / YouTube\nIn this video, Kloehn offers a tour of his Dumpster design.\nKloehn is listed as a \u201cDumpster Yoda\u201d who will provide expert advice to the Dumpster Project team.\nLinkedIn\nFacebook\nX\nTagged categories: Aesthetics; Color + Design; Design; Eco-efficiency; Energy efficiency; Green building; Research; Sustainability\nComments\nJoin the Conversation:\nSign in to add your comments.\nMain News Page\nRESOURCES\nBuying Guides and Directories\nDownloads\nIndustry Standards\nInstructional Videos\nSOCIAL CONNECTIONS\nX\nFacebook\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nUSEFUL INFORMATION\nAbout Us\nMedia Kits and Advertising Submission Guidelines\nPaintSquare Staff\nPrivacy Policy\nRegistration and Free Subscriptions\nSite Map\nSocial Media\nSupport\nTerms and Conditions\nTHE TECHNOLOGY PUBLISHING NETWORK\nHeadquarters\n1501 Reedsdale Street, Suite 2008, Pittsburgh, PA 15233\nTEL: 1-412-431-8300\nEMAIL: info@paintsquare.com\nPaintSquare / JPCL\nCONTACT: sales@paintsquare.com\nPaint BidTracker\nCONTACT: sales@paintbidtracker.com\nWater BidTracker\nCONTACT: sales@waterbidtracker.com\nTPC Custom Publishing\nCONTACT: sales@technologypub.com",

At first, even members of the sustainable campus group \"Green Is The New Black\" expressed reservations.\n\"I didn't believe it at all. I'm like you're really going to live in a dumpster?\" said Huston-Tillotson University student Charles Deshaw.\nWilson calls his move an experiment in getting everyone to think tiny.\n\"To explore the whole idea of less, what happens to your life when you compact the space and the amount of stuff you have,\" Wilson said.\nWhen he first moved into the dumpster, it had no frills and looked more like camping. Now in phase two of \"The Dumpster Project,\" it feels a little more like a home.\nSo much so, that Eyewitness News reporter Steve Campion was invited to spend the night in the dumpster. He took the trip to Austin on one of the coldest days of the year, with temperatures hovering just above freezing. He had a similar experience to one of Wilson's most frightening experiences in the dumpster.\n\"The most terrifying night was the second night. It was about 27 degrees interior temperature and exactly 4:01 a.m., the trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors, a bit of a shock,\" Wilson said.\nAt the end of Campion's humble stay at the dumpster, Wilson's mission hit home.\n\"Foster a conversation and keep that conversation going. We don't know where that conversation is going to lead,\" Wilson said.\nFor now, he is only in the second phase of transforming the dumpster into the tiniest, sustainable living space.\nHis eventual goal is to use what he has learned and build the smallest home in Austin up to code.\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 KTRK-TV.

Dr. Jeff Wilson of Huston-Tillotson University, however, is doing just that. Working with his students and the community, he's transforming an old dumpster and living in it for a year.\nGizmag has covered tiny living spaces made from all sorts of things previously, including repurposed water tanks and shipping containers. We've never featured a home made from a dumpster before, though.\nMORE STORIES\nARCHITECTURE\nWasp-inspired setup 3D-prints complete homes for $1,000\nTINY HOUSES\nEasy-to-tow tiny house doubles down on space-saving design\nThe aim of the Dumpster Project is to investigate sustainable living practices in recognition of a world with an increasing population but decreasing space and resources to go around. The dumpster itself is 33 sq ft (3 sq m), compared to the average American home of 2,500 sq ft (232 sq m). Wilson says he is not suggesting that everyone should consider downscaling to such an extent, but should consider to what extent they can \"do with less\" and hopes that the project will encourage conversations and ideas around the topic.\nElectricity has been installed in the dumpster (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore)\nIn the bid to see whether a dumpster of this size could provide a legitimate living space, a number of modifications have been (and continue to be) made. In order to prepare the dumpster, it had to be thoroughly cleaned and rust-proofed. Insulation was required to provide some degree of warmth, and more simple solutions such as a clothes line and rain garden were added.\nMore complex additions, meanwhile, have included solar panels to generate electricity, a high-efficiency toilet, a false floor to provide storage, a weather station, air conditioning, a pitched roof, locks and a mailbox. The pockets have been sealed so that the dumpster cannot be mistaken for and serviced as a standard trash receptacle, and Wilson has furnished the inside.\nThe Dumpster is located on the Huston-Tillotson University campus in Austin, Texas. The project began last year, and Wilson moved into the dumpster on February 4th of this year. He plans to inhabit it for at least 12 months.\nThe video below is a documentary of the first six months of the Dumpster Project.\nSource: The Dumpster Project\nVIEW GALLERY - 19 IMAGES\nTAGS\nARCHITECTUREHOUSETINYSUSTAINABILITYREUSEHUSTON TILLOTSON UNIVERSITY\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlipboard\nLinkedIn\n18 COMMENTS\nMOST VIEWED\nAUTOMOTIVE\nNew Ford Nugget camper vans make van life even tastier\nMARINE\nWatch: Twin-hull hydrofoiling catamaran smashes big-wave storm tests\nHEALTH & WELLBEING\nHow exercise affects diabetic blood sugar levels depends on gender\nLOAD MORE\n18 COMMENTS\nSign in to post a comment.\nPlease keep comments to less than 150 words.

Because he is crazy to leave her for a dumpster - and she was looking at him like he was crazy. Second: I think we all know we are in trouble. In 1953 there were 2.69 billion, in midcentury there will be 10 billion. Smaller spaces probably wont stop global warming, ocean creep and food and water shortage. So what's the point? Last question: is there something we can all do to really alleviate our world's ills short of mass suicide? I think just getting out to walk and bike will start us on the path to doing something that we can all do - and that is changing our midset about our environment and how to protect it and to inculcate habits that will lead us in the right direction - not living in 3 meters and talking about solutions but actually doing them en-mass.\nNairda OCTOBER 16, 2014 09:58 PM\nIf you're living under high voltage power lines it would be good as long as its grounded correctly. Not a half bad bomb shelter in its own right. :)\nAlso, people complain a lot. If you give the average man of our generation a 60\" 4k TV, cable and a decent computer rig /console, he is more then happy to enjoy that cubicle for many seasons. And we're talking first world.\nRe: Conny S\u00f6re If the solar panels can drive a small 200W DC aircon compressor, then it is very sustainable. And those are moderately priced. Though not completely inexpensive. The outlay with the panels would still be the biggest cost to this project.\nGrunt OCTOBER 17, 2014 10:35 AM\nIt's a little worrying that this man is a university lecturer who has influence over young people, but then he is american and probably largely unaware of how huge numbers of people already exist in similar accommodation elsewhere in this world.

        "content": "DONATE\nEnvironment\n\u2018Professor Dumpster\u2019 has turned a big trash bin into a tiny home\nLiving on Earth\nOctober 10, 2014\nBy Adam Wernick\nDr. Jeff Wilson, otherwise known as Professor Dumpster, resides in a modern dumpster behind the women\u2019s dorm at Huston-Tillotson University. \nCourtesy of Jeff Wilson\nDr. Jeff Wilson is taking a novel approach to teaching sustainability: he's living in a dumpster.\nThe Dumpster Project is not a gimmick: it's a serious experiment in sustainable living. \u201cThe main point of this entire experiment is to test if one can have a pretty good life on a whole lot less,\u201d says Wilson, who's professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Wilson has unsurprisingly become known as Professor Dumpster.\n\u201cThis is obviously an extreme example,\" he says. \"I've moved into 36 square feet, which is 1 percent the size of the average new American home today.\u201d\nWilson will try to generate only 1 percent of the waste and use only 1 percent of the water and energy of the average American home during the first year of the experiment. The first phase, which Wilson calls \"dumpster camping,\" has been successful, but not particularly comfortable: the dumpster had no plumbing or electricity.\nIn February, when he first moved in, temperatures dipped below 35 degrees several times. \"Generally, the temperature inside was the [same as] the temperature outside,\u201d he says.\nThe lack of plumbing was also an issue, as one might imagine. \u201cNot only is it not a lot of fun urinating into a bottle when it's an emergency, or running to the nearest building in the middle of the night; it's also a problem in terms of design,\" Wilson says. \"Dealing with waste in a healthy way that doesn't give off much of a fragrance in such a small space, and also [meets] coding regulations.\u201d\nIn Austin, it's currently illegal to have a composting toilet. \u201cWhat we are probably going to have to do is attach something to the outside of the dumpster or expand one of the walls and just capture the blackwater like in an RV,\u201d Wilson explains.\nNow, Wilson is entering the second phase of the experiment: turning the dumpster into an average studio apartment that uses normal appliances. \u201cIn this phase, we're going to get a fairly normal toilet and shower head,\" he says. \"We'll probably expand out a few of the walls to give us a little bit more space to do this.\"\nDuring the second phase of his dumpster experiment, Jeff Moore is turning into into a super-tiny studio with the usual amenities.\nSarah Natsumi Moore\nAfter collecting baseline data on the water and energy usage of the \u201cnormal stuff,\u201d Wilson will move into the third phase \u2014 which he calls \u201c\u00fcber dumpster.\u201d He hopes to add a sleeping loft, heating and air-conditioning and a water collection system \u2014 even a folding balcony.\nHe'll also switch to solar energy, lower-flow equipment and other newer technologies in the hope of reaching his goal of reducing his water, energy and waste to 1 percent of an average American home.\n\u201cWe're looking to reach out to the public and reach out to our students for ideas,\u201d Wilson says. \u201c[Particularly] ideas on the toilet. It's one of the biggest problems. I mean, the idea of a toilet \u2014 the pure ridiculousness of it: that you've got to have this big piece of porcelain; you've got to have a whole sewage system; you've got to have a couple gallons of fresh water. These are some of the things that I think we're able to attack in a very small way.\u201d\nSo why a dumpster and not a tiny house \u2014 or even a shipping container? Wilson says he chose a dumpster specifically to build awareness about waste. People tend to think of dumpsters as \u201cthese magical boxes that we put our waste into and come back a few days later and everything's disappeared,\u201d Wilson says.\nUltimately, The Dumpster Project is about educating people, Wilson says. \u201cI like to think of the dumpster as a conversation box. As long as a conversation continues to go on, whether it be about sustainability, climate change, [or] tiny homes, I think we'll have accomplished our goal.\u201d\nThis story is based on an interview that aired on PRI's Living on Earth with Steve Curwood\nSign up for our daily newsletter\nSign up for The Top of the World, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.\nEmail Address\nSUBSCRIBE\nI have read and agree to your Privacy Policy.\nLatest Headlines\nSmall Brazilian town of Prudent\u00f3polis celebrates Ukrainian ties \nFor Germany\u2019s beer capital, a new buzz\nEnvironmental activists jailed in Cambodia \nElon Musk and court justice spar over freedom of speech in Brazil\nOut of Eden Walk: Witnessing the 2021 Myanmar coup\nNearly half of Venezuelans are considering leaving the country in the coming months, poll says\nYemenis unify around Houthis in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza\nThe rocky road to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival\n\u2018Serduchka is Ukraine\u2019: Pop star comedian says his job is to lift Ukrainian morale\nAfter the gold: A look at how some Olympic champions are being welcomed home\nMORE STORIES\nFollow The World\nSubscribe to The World\u2019s Latest Edition podcast for free using your favorite podcast player:\nApple Podcasts\nSpotify\nGoogle Podcasts\nRSS\nSign up for our daily newsletter\nSign up for The Top of the World, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.\nEmail Address\nI have read and agree to your Privacy Policy.\nRelated Content\nWhich cold foods do people across the globe enjoy during sweltering summer months?\nA look at the impact of pollution on rivers and efforts to keep them clean\n\u2018This is a whale nursery\u2019: The Day of the Right Whale in southern Brazil\nJapan\u2019s oldest village tries to attract new, younger residents\nCategories\nEnvironment\nEnvironment\nTags\nDumpster\nEnvironment\nIntentional Living\nSocial Change\nSustainable Living\nAustin\nUnited States\nTexas\nJeff Wilson\nProfessor Dumpster\nDumpster\nEnvironment\nIntentional Living\nSocial Change\nSustainability\nSustainable Living\nWaste\nWaste Containers\nThe World is a public radio program that crosses borders and time zones to bring home the stories that matter.\nProduced by\n.PRX-Logo-Horizontal-Color_svg__st1{fill:#0089bd}\nThanks to our sponsor\nMajor funding provided by\nAbout\nContact\nDonate\nMeet the Team\nPrivacy\nTerms of use\n\u00a92024 The World from PRX\nPRX is a 501(c)(3) organization recognized by the IRS: #263347402.",

The event is sponsored the Bobcat Net Impact student organization. It is free and open to the public.\nWith a 33-square-foot dumpster and a team of students and experts, Wilson will transform the dumpster from a barely habitable used garbage container to a sustainable house and interactive teaching lab, drawing attention to the fact that much of the Third World survives in housing of similar size.\nDuring his ambitious project, Wilson will make a dumpster his home for a full year starting in fall of 2013. The initial phases of the project amounted to essentially \"dumpster camping\" in the bare-bones frame. Over the course of the year, the dumpster will be retrofitted into a modern dwelling space with all the amenities of a standard American home (shower, toilet, kitchen, bed and WiFi access). By living in the dumpster, Wilson will not only experiment with innovative ways to live with less, but will also serve as the friendly face for the educational side of the project.\nWilson is a Texas State alumnus, having earned his Master's in Geography from the university.\nFor more information, visit http://dumpsterproject.org.\nNewsroom\n601 University Dr.\nJ.C.

He\u2019s also the face of The Dumpster Project, an educational experiment that aims to transform a 33-square-foot trash dumpster into a fully sustainable space.\n\"There was no mint on the pillow,\" he says, \"and it wasn't exactly the W, but I did stay warm.\"\nStudents will work with Wilson to retrofit the dumpster throughout the year. Their work began, rightfully, by cleaning the dumpster out, as seen in this Instagram clip: \nThe idea is for the dumpster to gradually progress from few amenities to the latest in sustainable technology \u2013 all while maintaining a \"net zero\" model of energy use.\nWilson credits those student volunteers \u2013 Green is the New Black \u2013 as the group guiding and pushing the project. \"I'm just the guy living in the dumpster and acting as their advisor.\"\nWilson \u2013 a white professor at a historically black college \u2013 says the volunteers' \"vision is to transform the way that the green conversation is going in our particular community, over here at Huston-Tillotson \u2013 and they are fostering new shades of green as the roots of our future.\"\nThey should have a little help \u2013 the Dumpster Project recently won a  $75,000 grant from Ford Motor Company. \n\"The key endpoint,\" says Wilson, \"at least for me, would be that there is a conversation \u2013 contextual to whatever an individual\u2019s beliefs and thoughts are \u2013 around issues of less and more.\"\nCare to see it for yourself?

He apparently had a lot of time to think in his dingy dumpster digs, and has since designed a line of tiny but technologically power-packed homes being manufactured in Austin.\nWilson calls the design Kasita - inspired by \"casita\", which is Spanish for \"small house\". He told KVUE-TV that his iPhone, which I'm sure was his only company in that dumpster, inspired him to create a home that would utilize every inch of space and pack features into a compact and sleek design.\nTech features include windows that dim or clear on command, a TV that slides in and out of view depending on when its needed, and customized ambient settings, all controlled by an app. They'll be on display at this year's South by Southwest festival in Austin, so look for them if you have a chance to head down there.\nEach 352 square foot house costs about $139,000, and there are plans in the works to build racks upon which to stack the homes like portable apartments.\n'Professor Dumpster' debuting affordable Kasita housing in Austin this fall\nSubscribe to KTEM-AM on\nCONTAINER HOMES COMING TO TEMPLE\nHANK THE COWDOG AUTHOR LOSES HOME IN NORTH TEXAS WILDFIRES\nFiled Under: News, Professor Dumpster, SXSW, SXSW 2017, Texas News, Tiny House\nCategories: Articles, News, Texas News\nMORE FROM KTEM-AM\nAustin Cancels SXSW Over Coronavirus Outbreak Concerns\nAustin Cancels SXSW Over Coronavirus Outbreak Concerns\nJordan Peele\u2019s New Movie \u201cUs\u201d To Premiere In Austin At SXSW\nJordan Peele\u2019s New Movie \u201cUs\u201d To Premiere In Austin At SXSW\nAustin Man Arrested for Bomb Threat at SXSW\nAustin Man Arrested for Bomb Threat at SXSW\nSXSW Shooting Suspect Leads Killeen Police on Car Chase\nSXSW Shooting Suspect Leads Killeen Police on Car Chase\nKilleen Man Arrested in Connection to SXSW Shooting\nKilleen Man Arrested in Connection to SXSW Shooting\nAustin Mayor Urges Residents to Work From Home Friday\nAustin Mayor Urges Residents to Work From Home Friday\nKilleen Man Identified as Driver in Deadly South by Southwest Crash\nKilleen Man Identified as Driver in Deadly South by Southwest Crash\nTwo Killed, Dozens Injured by Suspected Drunken Driver at SXSW\nTwo Killed, Dozens Injured by Suspected Drunken Driver at SXSW\nWHAT'S HOT\nSelf-Serve Bars In Texas \u2013 A Self Checkout No One Will Mind\nSELF-SERVE BARS IN TEXAS \u2013 A SELF CHECKOUT NO ONE WILL MIND\nINFORMATION\nEEO Report\nMarketing and Advertising Solutions\nPublic File\nNeed Assistance\nFCC Applications\nReport an Inaccuracy\nTerms\nContest Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nExercise My Data Rights\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nContact\nKilleen Business Listings\nFOLLOW US\nVisit us on Youtube\nVisit us on Facebook\nVisit us on Twitter\nVisit us on Instagram\n2024 KTEM NewsRadio 14, Townsquare Media, Inc.

Dr. Jeff Wilson of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas literally (or litter-ally as he likes to spell it) lives in a dumpster. \nIt's all part of The Dumpster Project, an experiment in sustainability that sees Professor Dumpster and students at Huston-Tillotson retrofitting a dumpster to meet sustainable and livable standards. \"Science needs to be juiced up a bit,\" said Wilson. \"I have been an environmental science teacher for the past six years, and I'm tired of kids falling asleep in class.\"\nThe Dumpster Project has certainly gotten people's attention. Dr. Wilson and his students recently hosted a \"dumpster warming\" party to mark the start of what will hopefully be a long a fruitful endeavor for all involved. Around 250 people came to the event, which was accompanied by student presentations related to the project.\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of the Dumpster Project is its symbolic nature, as Wilson will be conserving resources where they are normally discarded. Nevertheless, Wilson believes that facilitating dialogue is more important than metaphorical meaning. \"The end game is that the dumpster becomes a conversation,\" said Wilson. \"For some people it'll be about sustainability, for some people it will be about less is more, for some people it will be a business proposition. We just want a conversation.\"\nAs of now, the dumpster is still in what Wilson describes as the \"primitive camping\" phase. This means that Wilson is essentially camping, except that his tent is a dumpster. But Wilson plans on transforming his humble abode into an \"\u00fcber dumpster\" equipped with solar powered electricity while at the same time using only 1% of the energy and water used in a normal American home.\n\"This is an experiment to show that one can have a pretty good life using limited resources.\" While initially trepidatious, the administration at Huston-Tillotson is now fully supportive of the project. But not everyone is as enthusiastic, as some bizarre and misdirected criticism has come his way. \"I've been accused of telling people that under Obama we have to live in dumpsters,\" said Wilson.\nThough the project has undeniably provoked discussion, the educational opportunities that it provides is perhaps its most tangible effect. For the students at Huston-Tillotson, an historically black college, this aspect of the Dumpster Project is invaluable.\n\"What's so cool (about the project) is the students,\" said Wilson \"Over 90% are first generation university students, and for them to have exposure to global experts is an amazing opportunity.\"\nWilson particularly highlights the contributions of Green is the New Black, a student group at Huston-Tillotson that is committed to transforming the environmental conversation within African-American and Latino communities.\nYou can follow the Dumpster Project's progress on Professor Dumpster's Twitter and Instagram pages.\n--Image courtest of Jeff Wilson\nCallum Beals is an editorial intern at Sierra. he recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz where he studied history and literature.

The first house will be delivered at the end of June, but prospective buyers can tour the model home at 1304 E. Fourth St.\n\nThe application for orders opened Friday, and while the company will not reveal how many orders it has received since Friday, Kasita Director of Communications Courtney Lowell said they are \"overwhelmingly pleased\" with the demand.\n\n[g-slider gid=\"228018\" width=\"100%\" height=\"55%\"]\n\n\"Everything is designed with the idea of user experience,\" Lowell said of the microhouse. That means smart home technology, greater use of storage space and easy delivery\u2014Kasitas are manufactured in a factory in a few weeks and delivered in one piece via flatbed truck.\n\nBy December, Kasita hopes to start selling stackable houses. Imagine nine tiny homes, one on top of the other, accessible by an exterior, covered elevator, on a lot that would otherwise be unusable, Lowell said.\n\nThe houses on sale now even come with a discount\u2014buy three or more, and the price drops to $119,000 each.\n\nLowell said, eventually, the company hopes to see the units sold for an even more affordable price.\n\nShe said Austin was the perfect place to create and debut the Kasita, outside of technology-heavy areas ,such as Silicon Valley and New York City. Austin, she argues, is the \"quintessential\" place to launch Kasitas because of its current housing situation.\n\nCommunity leaders have said the key to making Austin affordable is to make affordable housing available. According to data from the Austin Board of Realtors, the median single-family home price in Austin rose 10.6 percent to $345,000 since September 2015. The National Association of Homebuilders reports for every $1,000 increase in the median home value, 1,285 Austin families can no longer afford the market.\n\nLowell said the idea is to place Kasitas in underutilized spaces\u2014rooftops, parking lots, areas that are too small to build conventional houses or apartments. And similar to an iPhone, Kasitas are able to be mass-produced because there is not much customization, so it is less expensive to manufacture.\n\nWilson\u2014who started out in a 33-square-foot-dumpster on Austin's Huston-Tillotson University campus three years ago\u2014said he hopes his product eventually goes global.\n\nBy Marie Albiges\nThanks for reading!\nDaily news about your community is free, and your support is invaluable.\nGive $10 now towards CI's journalistic mission across Texas.\nBecome a CI Patron\nAustin Metro\nAustin Metro Home\nBastrop | Cedar Creek\nCedar Park | Far Northwest Austin\nGeorgetown\nLake Travis | Westlake\nLeander | Liberty Hill\nNorth Central Austin\nNorth | Northwest Austin\nPflugerville | Hutto\nRound Rock\nSan Marcos | Buda | Kyle\nSouth Central Austin\nSouthwest Austin | Dripping Springs\nHouston Metro\nHouston Metro Home\nBay Area\nBellaire | Meyerland | West University\nConroe | Montgomery\nCy-Fair\nCypress\nHeights | River Oaks | Montrose\nKaty North\nKaty South | Fulshear\nLake Houston | Humble | Kingwood\nPearland | Friendswood\nSpring | Klein\nSugar Land | Missouri City\nThe Woodlands\nTomball | Magnolia\nDallas | Fort Worth Metro\nDallas | Fort Worth Metro Home\nFlower Mound | Highland Village | Argyle\nFrisco\nGrapevine | Colleyville | Southlake\nKeller | Roanoke | Northeast Fort Worth\nLewisville | Coppell\nMcKinney\nPlano North\nPlano South\nProsper | Celina\nRichardson\nSan Antonio Metro\nSan Antonio Metro Home\nNew Braunfels\nNorth San Antonio\nNortheast San Antonio Metrocom\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nYoutube\n(866) 989-6808\nTERMS OF SERVICE | PRIVACY POLICY |\n\u00a9 2005-2024 Community Impact Newspaper Co.

        "content": "Meet Professor Dumpster, the American College Professor Who Lives in a Dumpster\nBy Sumitra on September 16th, 2014 Category: News\nShare\nTwitter\nReddit\nDr. Jeff Wilson, a professor of environmental science at a university in Austin, Texas, is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year. He kickstarted the unique project in February, and his efforts have earned him the nickname \u2018Professor Dumpster\u2019 among his students. Harvard-educated Wilson says that his goal is to show people that it is possible to have a pretty good life even in austere conditions.\nThe dark green dumpster is currently parked behind the women\u2019s residence halls in a corner of Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s campus. Wilson describes it as \u2018the most thoughtfully designed, tiniest home ever constructed\u2019. Before he moved in, Wilson\u2019s students cleaned and fixed the dumpster for him, making sure that it wasn\u2019t smelly or unfit for living. And to make the dwelling as energy efficient as possible, they plan to set up solar panels and an energy producing toilet.\nHaving previously lived in a sprawling 2,500 square foot house, Wilson started downsizing his life after going through a divorce. He moved into a 500 square foot apartment, and sold all his spare clothes and furniture for $1 per item. He soon realized how little he needed to survive, and dumpster-living sounded like a great idea.\nWhen the lease on his apartment ran out, he moved into his office for seven months, while setting up the dumpster. \u201cKeeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3am cleaning staff and the 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,\u201d he admitted.\u201d But he soon pitched the idea at work, and got the university to sanction and support The Dumpster Project. The project revolves around using only one percent of what the average American uses \u2013 one percent of the space, the water, and the energy, and producing only one percent of the waste.\n\u201cWe could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson said, while pointing out the merits of a dumpster home. \u201cFueled by sunlight and surface water, people could have a pretty good laugh.\u201d He\u2019s a big believer in minimalism now \u2013 he owns only four pairs of pants, four shirts, three pairs of shoes, three hats, and a few bow ties. All his worldly possessions are stored under a recently installed false floor, along with camping cooking equipment.\nIt took Wilson a few months to get used to the place, but after installing some useful amenities, he started feeling comfortable in his new home. One of the first things he did was to replace the tarp roof with a sliding pitched roof with a weather station on top. Six months after he moved in, he installed a modest air conditioner in an effort to cope with the terrible Austin heat.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make it too easy,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI wanted to see how elastic my sleeping habits would be relative to temperature and humidity. I found that I could actually get to sleep pretty well as long as I went to bed at about 11:00pm.\u201d Using the weather station, he tracks his personal climate in real time, he pulls up weather-related data to know what to expect.\nWilson said that a lot of good things have happened because of the project \u2013 the summer\u2019s been unbearable, so he spent more time in the community, walking around and interacting with people. \u201cI almost feel like East Austin is my home and my backyard,\u201d he said proudly.\nIn the second phase of The Dumpster Project, Wilson will receive more amenities like a bed, a lamp, and a dome to catch rainwater and provide shade. He will also have a tiny sink and a kitchen, and locks, making it the only dumpster in the world with interior locks. But the one thing he\u2019s eagerly waiting for is a toilet.\nHe currently uses facilities at the university\u2019s gym, but \u201cgetting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run,\u201d he said. He will soon have his own shower and toilet, though, which will be connected externally. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,\u201d he explained.\nThe third phase of the project will see Wilson entering the \u2018uber dumpster home\u2019 \u2013 his dumpster will be unplugged from the energy grid and solar panels will be installed instead. More aesthetic work will be done as well, minimizing the dumpster effect. \u201cWe kind of want to do the outside in a modern Dwell look,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want it basically to be such that if you were blindfolded and placed inside it, you\u2019d just think you were in a very tiny house.\u201d\n\u201cWe bring everything into the home these days,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to leave home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What\u2019s interesting about this (project) is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home. The big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less? So far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I\u2019ve had before.\u201d\nHaving said that, Wilson does have an arrangement in place in case he needs an occasional break from the box. His students can opt to take his place for the night.\nOnce his year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans to take his bin across the United States, to educate students about the concept of \u2018less is more\u2019. He\u2019s already going around to local elementary and middle schools to talk about his experience of living in a home with no modern facilities. One of the most pressing questions he\u2019s been asked is: \u201cHow is Santa going to get in?\u201d\nPhotos: The Dumpster Project/Facebook\nSources: ABC News, MSN\nShare\nTwitter\nReddit\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

A third of rural Indians live in homes where each person gets just 65 square feet or less of living space.\nBut at 33 square feet, Austin University College Dean Jeff Wilson, a.k.a Professor Dumpster, has got them beat with his Dumpster Project. \nWilson took post-divorce downsizing to a whole new level by moving into a dumpster on the campus of the university where he teaches, paring down his possessions to some bedding, a couple shirts, and a few pairs of shoes and pants, all of which are stored in a compartment beneath a false floor installed into the dumpster, according to James Hamblin's Atlantic piece.  \nThe only thing Wilson did not skimp on was bowties (he has eight or nine), which arguably are necessary to add some flair to his otherwise limited wardrobe.\n                        Wilson moved from a  just-under-the-national-average 2,500-square foot home to the dumpster, which he is utilizing as an experiment to illustrate issues of sustanability and human needs to his students.\nAccording to the piece, Wilson has become more connected to his community (since his dumpster is too small and hot to actually spend time in, he tends to hang out in the laundromat.)\n\"I have met a much wider circle of people just from going to laundromats and wandering around outside of the dumpster when I would\u2019ve been in there if I had a large flat screen and a La-Z Boy,\u201d he says.\nHis zero-waste, zero-energy home lacks certain amenities most Americans would consider basic, such as a toilet. But Wilson, who admits his project is \"an outlier experiment,\"  is not alone there; even in the wealthiest country on earth, 1.6 million Americans lack indoor plumbing.\nWilson does have plans for a toilet, as well as a shower and a washer/dryer (so long, laundromat), all fueled by city water, a connection to the electrical grid, and a shade structure to protect the dumpster from the scorching Texas sun.\n    Image source: The Atlantic\nLonger term plans include a pop-up bedroom structure, folding balcony, and raised bed garden.\nWilson's goal is to demonstrate what is possible with ingenuity and a willingness to rethink how much stuff a person needs to own and store in a house for a happy life.\n\"What\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home,\u201d he tells the Atlantic.\nIf you have \"disposable income\" and would like to \"pitch in\" to help Wilson's project, visit his website and make a donation.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nNina Ignaczak\nNina edits and publishes the Planet Detroit newsletter (planetdetroit.substack.com) and writes and edits stories about all aspects of people and place.\nSUBSCRIBE\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest sharing news:\n*Required field.

He admits managing the toilet smells can be an issue\n+\n9\nView gallery\nMaintaining a comfortable temperature was initially a problem until Mr Wilson built temperature controls\nDesigns may include solar power generation, a composting toilet, a flat screen television, and a passive-solar heated shower \n'I'm not as concerned about the shower,' he told The Atlantic, 'but getting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run.'\nCurrently, he uses facilities at the university's gym, but a toilet and shower will soon connect to the dumpster externally. \n'You don't really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,' he explained. \nAfter the year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the United States, educating students about the possibility of following in his 'less is more' footsteps.\nWilson said the project idea came to him two years ago while he was sipping a latte at Starbucks.\n'I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster,' he told Fast Company.\nSo when the lease ran out on his lovely, full-sized, apartment a year later, he posted an announcement on Facebook, which read: 'Starting at 6pm, I will be selling all of my home furnishings, clothes, kitchen appliances, and everything else in the apartment for $1 an item.' \nDespite, the five-item-per-person maximum, his home was empty by nightfall except for a modest suitcase, which was coming with him to the dumpster.\nHowever, the dumpster wasn't ready at that stage, so he moved into his office for the next seven months, secretly sleeping on the floor until he moved in, in Feburary. \n'Keeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3 a.m. cleaning staff and 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,' he told the website.  \nHe said: 'We hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing, energy sustainability, science education, and higher quality of life.\n'Ultimately, the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing.\n'This is an outlier experiment. The students and university, thought they thought the experiment a bit odd, have warmed to the idea, even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to.'\n   Share or comment on this article: Texas professor Jeff Wilson adjusts to life in a dumpster\n14\nshares\nRecommended by\nCash-strapped Chinese cities bring in over $50bn from fines\nNikkei Asia | Sponsored\nWho says a baby can\u2019t enjoy a little taste of the luxe life for less?

        "content": "Meet Professor Dumpster, the American College Professor Who Lives in a Dumpster\nBy Sumitra on September 16th, 2014 Category: News\nShare\nTwitter\nReddit\nDr. Jeff Wilson, a professor of environmental science at a university in Austin, Texas, is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year. He kickstarted the unique project in February, and his efforts have earned him the nickname \u2018Professor Dumpster\u2019 among his students. Harvard-educated Wilson says that his goal is to show people that it is possible to have a pretty good life even in austere conditions.\nThe dark green dumpster is currently parked behind the women\u2019s residence halls in a corner of Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s campus. Wilson describes it as \u2018the most thoughtfully designed, tiniest home ever constructed\u2019. Before he moved in, Wilson\u2019s students cleaned and fixed the dumpster for him, making sure that it wasn\u2019t smelly or unfit for living. And to make the dwelling as energy efficient as possible, they plan to set up solar panels and an energy producing toilet.\nHaving previously lived in a sprawling 2,500 square foot house, Wilson started downsizing his life after going through a divorce. He moved into a 500 square foot apartment, and sold all his spare clothes and furniture for $1 per item. He soon realized how little he needed to survive, and dumpster-living sounded like a great idea.\nWhen the lease on his apartment ran out, he moved into his office for seven months, while setting up the dumpster. \u201cKeeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3am cleaning staff and the 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,\u201d he admitted.\u201d But he soon pitched the idea at work, and got the university to sanction and support The Dumpster Project. The project revolves around using only one percent of what the average American uses \u2013 one percent of the space, the water, and the energy, and producing only one percent of the waste.\n\u201cWe could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson said, while pointing out the merits of a dumpster home. \u201cFueled by sunlight and surface water, people could have a pretty good laugh.\u201d He\u2019s a big believer in minimalism now \u2013 he owns only four pairs of pants, four shirts, three pairs of shoes, three hats, and a few bow ties. All his worldly possessions are stored under a recently installed false floor, along with camping cooking equipment.\nIt took Wilson a few months to get used to the place, but after installing some useful amenities, he started feeling comfortable in his new home. One of the first things he did was to replace the tarp roof with a sliding pitched roof with a weather station on top. Six months after he moved in, he installed a modest air conditioner in an effort to cope with the terrible Austin heat.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make it too easy,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI wanted to see how elastic my sleeping habits would be relative to temperature and humidity. I found that I could actually get to sleep pretty well as long as I went to bed at about 11:00pm.\u201d Using the weather station, he tracks his personal climate in real time, he pulls up weather-related data to know what to expect.\nWilson said that a lot of good things have happened because of the project \u2013 the summer\u2019s been unbearable, so he spent more time in the community, walking around and interacting with people. \u201cI almost feel like East Austin is my home and my backyard,\u201d he said proudly.\nIn the second phase of The Dumpster Project, Wilson will receive more amenities like a bed, a lamp, and a dome to catch rainwater and provide shade. He will also have a tiny sink and a kitchen, and locks, making it the only dumpster in the world with interior locks. But the one thing he\u2019s eagerly waiting for is a toilet.\nHe currently uses facilities at the university\u2019s gym, but \u201cgetting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run,\u201d he said. He will soon have his own shower and toilet, though, which will be connected externally. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,\u201d he explained.\nThe third phase of the project will see Wilson entering the \u2018uber dumpster home\u2019 \u2013 his dumpster will be unplugged from the energy grid and solar panels will be installed instead. More aesthetic work will be done as well, minimizing the dumpster effect. \u201cWe kind of want to do the outside in a modern Dwell look,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want it basically to be such that if you were blindfolded and placed inside it, you\u2019d just think you were in a very tiny house.\u201d\n\u201cWe bring everything into the home these days,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to leave home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What\u2019s interesting about this (project) is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home. The big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less? So far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I\u2019ve had before.\u201d\nHaving said that, Wilson does have an arrangement in place in case he needs an occasional break from the box. His students can opt to take his place for the night.\nOnce his year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans to take his bin across the United States, to educate students about the concept of \u2018less is more\u2019. He\u2019s already going around to local elementary and middle schools to talk about his experience of living in a home with no modern facilities. One of the most pressing questions he\u2019s been asked is: \u201cHow is Santa going to get in?\u201d\nPhotos: The Dumpster Project/Facebook\nSources: ABC News, MSN\nShare\nTwitter\nReddit\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

Wilson has unsurprisingly become known as Professor Dumpster.\n\u201cThis is obviously an extreme example,\" he says. \"I've moved into 36 square feet, which is 1 percent the size of the average new American home today.\u201d\nWilson will try to generate only 1 percent of the waste and use only 1 percent of the water and energy of the average American home during the first year of the experiment. The first phase, which Wilson calls \"dumpster camping,\" has been successful, but not particularly comfortable: the dumpster had no plumbing or electricity.\nIn February, when he first moved in, temperatures dipped below 35 degrees several times. \"Generally, the temperature inside was the [same as] the temperature outside,\u201d he says.\nThe lack of plumbing was also an issue, as one might imagine. \u201cNot only is it not a lot of fun urinating into a bottle when it's an emergency, or running to the nearest building in the middle of the night; it's also a problem in terms of design,\" Wilson says. \"Dealing with waste in a healthy way that doesn't give off much of a fragrance in such a small space, and also [meets] coding regulations.\u201d\nIn Austin, it's currently illegal to have a composting toilet. \u201cWhat we are probably going to have to do is attach something to the outside of the dumpster or expand one of the walls and just capture the blackwater like in an RV,\u201d Wilson explains.\nNow, Wilson is entering the second phase of the experiment: turning the dumpster into an average studio apartment that uses normal appliances. \u201cIn this phase, we're going to get a fairly normal toilet and shower head,\" he says. \"We'll probably expand out a few of the walls to give us a little bit more space to do this.\"\nDuring the second phase of his dumpster experiment, Jeff Moore is turning into into a super-tiny studio with the usual amenities.\nSarah Natsumi Moore\nAfter collecting baseline data on the water and energy usage of the \u201cnormal stuff,\u201d Wilson will move into the third phase \u2014 which he calls \u201c\u00fcber dumpster.\u201d He hopes to add a sleeping loft, heating and air-conditioning and a water collection system \u2014 even a folding balcony.\nHe'll also switch to solar energy, lower-flow equipment and other newer technologies in the hope of reaching his goal of reducing his water, energy and waste to 1 percent of an average American home.\n\u201cWe're looking to reach out to the public and reach out to our students for ideas,\u201d Wilson says. \u201c[Particularly] ideas on the toilet. It's one of the biggest problems. I mean, the idea of a toilet \u2014 the pure ridiculousness of it: that you've got to have this big piece of porcelain; you've got to have a whole sewage system; you've got to have a couple gallons of fresh water. These are some of the things that I think we're able to attack in a very small way.\u201d\nSo why a dumpster and not a tiny house \u2014 or even a shipping container? Wilson says he chose a dumpster specifically to build awareness about waste. People tend to think of dumpsters as \u201cthese magical boxes that we put our waste into and come back a few days later and everything's disappeared,\u201d Wilson says.\nUltimately, The Dumpster Project is about educating people, Wilson says. \u201cI like to think of the dumpster as a conversation box. As long as a conversation continues to go on, whether it be about sustainability, climate change, [or] tiny homes, I think we'll have accomplished our goal.\u201d\nThis story is based on an interview that aired on PRI's Living on Earth with Steve Curwood\nSign up for our daily newsletter\nSign up for The Top of the World, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.\nEmail Address\nSUBSCRIBE\nI have read and agree to your Privacy Policy.\nLatest Headlines\nSmall Brazilian town of Prudent\u00f3polis celebrates Ukrainian ties \nFor Germany\u2019s beer capital, a new buzz\nEnvironmental activists jailed in Cambodia \nElon Musk and court justice spar over freedom of speech in Brazil\nOut of Eden Walk: Witnessing the 2021 Myanmar coup\nNearly half of Venezuelans are considering leaving the country in the coming months, poll says\nYemenis unify around Houthis in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza\nThe rocky road to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival\n\u2018Serduchka is Ukraine\u2019: Pop star comedian says his job is to lift Ukrainian morale\nAfter the gold: A look at how some Olympic champions are being welcomed home\nMORE STORIES\nFollow The World\nSubscribe to The World\u2019s Latest Edition podcast for free using your favorite podcast player:\nApple Podcasts\nSpotify\nGoogle Podcasts\nRSS\nSign up for our daily newsletter\nSign up for The Top of the World, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.\nEmail Address\nI have read and agree to your Privacy Policy.\nRelated Content\nWhich cold foods do people across the globe enjoy during sweltering summer months?\nA look at the impact of pollution on rivers and efforts to keep them clean\n\u2018This is a whale nursery\u2019: The Day of the Right Whale in southern Brazil\nJapan\u2019s oldest village tries to attract new, younger residents\nCategories\nEnvironment\nEnvironment\nTags\nDumpster\nEnvironment\nIntentional Living\nSocial Change\nSustainable Living\nAustin\nUnited States\nTexas\nJeff Wilson\nProfessor Dumpster\nDumpster\nEnvironment\nIntentional Living\nSocial Change\nSustainability\nSustainable Living\nWaste\nWaste Containers\nThe World is a public radio program that crosses borders and time zones to bring home the stories that matter.\nProduced by\n.PRX-Logo-Horizontal-Color_svg__st1{fill:#0089bd}\nThanks to our sponsor\nMajor funding provided by\nAbout\nContact\nDonate\nMeet the Team\nPrivacy\nTerms of use\n\u00a92024 The World from PRX\nPRX is a 501(c)(3) organization recognized by the IRS: #263347402.",

This question came to mind as I read about Professor Jeff Wilson and The Dumpster Project. A dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, Wilson embarked on an experiment to see if it was possible to live in a 36-square-foot dumpster.\nOver time, he\u2019s gone from sleeping on cardboard mats to adding custom touches like a sliding roof and an air conditioner. He sums up his sustainability experiment this way:\n\u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\nI\u2019ve shared before the idea of living a more minimalist life, but some of those stories have focused on the concept of a number. What\u2019s the smallest number of items I can own? Professor Wilson\u2019s story made me refocus on the idea of what items do we really need?\nWhat makes this perspective so interesting is that the answer varies by individual. It\u2019s incredibly personal and, I believe, an incredibly powerful process.\nThe goal isn\u2019t to get down to a number, but to better understand why we have what we have in our lives. In many ways, it goes back to the idea of buying good, quality items and owning them for a long time. If you aren\u2019t buying everything you see in the store, it becomes much more realistic to buy durable items that we really value and would otherwise be \u201ctoo expensive.\u201d\nA friend of mine recently moved into a new home. It\u2019s a larger place than she was in before, and because she\u2019s not married and doesn\u2019t have kids, people keep asking, \u201cWhat do you need all that space for?\u201d It turns out that for her, it was about location. Homes rarely come up for sale in the area she wanted to live.\nAs a result, she jumped at the chance to buy the home, despite the greater square footage. It means more time spent cleaning, but now, she literally steps out the door and she\u2019s in nature. She\u2019s exactly where she wants to be.\nHowever, because she knows it\u2019s a real risk that she\u2019ll fill up the house if she\u2019s not careful, she\u2019s adopted a one in, one out rule. For everything new she wants to bring into the house, something old needs to go out. Some of you probably follow this rule too, and like Professor Wilson\u2019s experiment, it goes back to this idea of thoughtful consumption.\nWhat do we really need? Are we buying things thoughtfully or carelessly? I believe our willingness to look at our buying behavior can have a huge impact on whether we reach the goals that we say matter most to us. If we get busy filling up our lives with things we don\u2019t need, it\u2019s easy to get distracted. So this weekend, I have a challenge for you.\nTake a look at your possessions and identify three things you consider necessities in your life. Then, take a look around at the rest of your stuff. If you had to give up everything else you own to keep those three items, could you? Or does something else start to look more important?\nBy the end of this experiment, you\u2019ll have a much better idea of how to answer the question, \u201cWhat do I really need?\u201d\n. . .\nDid you like this article?

He\u2019s also the face of The Dumpster Project, an educational experiment that aims to transform a 33-square-foot trash dumpster into a fully sustainable space.\n\"There was no mint on the pillow,\" he says, \"and it wasn't exactly the W, but I did stay warm.\"\nStudents will work with Wilson to retrofit the dumpster throughout the year. Their work began, rightfully, by cleaning the dumpster out, as seen in this Instagram clip: \nThe idea is for the dumpster to gradually progress from few amenities to the latest in sustainable technology \u2013 all while maintaining a \"net zero\" model of energy use.\nWilson credits those student volunteers \u2013 Green is the New Black \u2013 as the group guiding and pushing the project. \"I'm just the guy living in the dumpster and acting as their advisor.\"\nWilson \u2013 a white professor at a historically black college \u2013 says the volunteers' \"vision is to transform the way that the green conversation is going in our particular community, over here at Huston-Tillotson \u2013 and they are fostering new shades of green as the roots of our future.\"\nThey should have a little help \u2013 the Dumpster Project recently won a  $75,000 grant from Ford Motor Company. \n\"The key endpoint,\" says Wilson, \"at least for me, would be that there is a conversation \u2013 contextual to whatever an individual\u2019s beliefs and thoughts are \u2013 around issues of less and more.\"\nCare to see it for yourself?

The pre-fabricated homes can be constructed in three weeks \u2014 and could go a long way toward easing the affordable housing crunch that has bedeviled much of the country.\nWith the help of former employees at Google, Elon Musk's SolarCity and Bell Helicopter, Wilson thinks he has a solution to provide homes and stackable apartments in unused pieces of land such as vacant parking lots. \"If you file for a backyard unit, it can be approved in weeks,\" says Wilson, who predicts his homes could hit the market this summer.\n\"We need to find cracks in the system rather than take a sledgehammer to it,\" he says.\nIf the reaction of consumers at Kasita's recent party at SXSW is any indication, interest is high. Hundreds patiently waited in line to get a peek at the modular home, which features a bathroom/shower, kitchen, bedroom and living room patio.\nA remote control allows dwellers to quickly change mood lighting and an entertainment system. Date mode finds Marvin Gaye's smooth voice filling the small living area. Storage space is built into steps, walls and other nooks and crannies.\nThe 21-person start-up, based here, is not only espousing the mantra that small is beautiful, but it can be environmental and profitable. Wilson says several mayors are interested in the homes, and he intends to visit California to make his pitch this month.\n\"Green is the new black,\" Wilson says.\nFollow USA TODAY's San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.\nCan You Trust Your Tongue To Taste Excess Salt?\nTaking excess salt makes the tongue less sensitive to the taste of salt.

At first, even members of the sustainable campus group \"Green Is The New Black\" expressed reservations.\n\"I didn't believe it at all. I'm like you're really going to live in a dumpster?\" said Huston-Tillotson University student Charles Deshaw.\nWilson calls his move an experiment in getting everyone to think tiny.\n\"To explore the whole idea of less, what happens to your life when you compact the space and the amount of stuff you have,\" Wilson said.\nWhen he first moved into the dumpster, it had no frills and looked more like camping. Now in phase two of \"The Dumpster Project,\" it feels a little more like a home.\nSo much so, that Eyewitness News reporter Steve Campion was invited to spend the night in the dumpster. He took the trip to Austin on one of the coldest days of the year, with temperatures hovering just above freezing. He had a similar experience to one of Wilson's most frightening experiences in the dumpster.\n\"The most terrifying night was the second night. It was about 27 degrees interior temperature and exactly 4:01 a.m., the trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors, a bit of a shock,\" Wilson said.\nAt the end of Campion's humble stay at the dumpster, Wilson's mission hit home.\n\"Foster a conversation and keep that conversation going. We don't know where that conversation is going to lead,\" Wilson said.\nFor now, he is only in the second phase of transforming the dumpster into the tiniest, sustainable living space.\nHis eventual goal is to use what he has learned and build the smallest home in Austin up to code.\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 KTRK-TV.

Here's what caught our eyes this week.\n'PROFESSOR DUMPSTER' ENTERS FIGHT AGAINST CORONAVIRUS\nJeff Wilson, founder of Austin-based Kasita, has launched a new venture that produces rapid-deployment recovery spaces for frontline health care workers and those needing to quarantine due to COVID-19.\nexpand\nJeff Wilson earned the nickname Professor Dumpster after living for a year in a converted dumpster, pictured, to test the limits of housing design and sustainability.\nKASITA\nWilson earned the nickname Professor Dumpster when he was on the faculty at Huston-Tillotson University and spent a year living in a converted dumpster to test the limits of housing design and sustainability. He later founded Kasita, once a buzzy Austin company that produced tiny homes, though it was reborn in 2019 under a new ownership group as a company that makes luxury hotel suites. At the time, the restructured Kasita's website said \"there was not enough consumer demand to support their plan to manufacture and sell tiny homes directly to consumers,\" leading Kasita in its original form to cease operations.\nWilson's new company, New York-based Jupe Inc., bills itself as a \"flat-packed housing startup built for crisis and disaster response,\" according to a March 26 announcement. Its latest product, Jupe Health, is designed to help hospitals deal with capacity issues in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The units are \"equipped with mobile bedding, technology, and amenities to support long-term containment efforts,\" according to the announcement.\n\u201cThe significant shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment \u2014 like ventilators \u2014 combined with the massive cost of quickly building the infrastructure and managing a hospital bedroom, which is about $1 million per unit all-in, is a massive undertaking. Hospitals can\u2019t tackle it all rapidly enough, even once the federal government\u2019s aid package kicks in,\u201d said Dr. Esther Choo, chief medical advisor to Jupe Health.\nCOMPANY APOLOGIZES FOR 'ILL-ADVISED' PAY CUT\nOklahoma City-based ImageNet Consulting has shelved a plan to temporarily reduce employee pay in line with forthcoming federal stimulus checks.\nLast week the consulting firm, which has an Austin office off West Braker Lane, asked employees to acknowledge its new Employee Emergency Compensation Program, which requested that employees agree to a \"temporary compensation reduction that is in line with the assistance that it receives from the federal government related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\" A copy of the employee acknowledgement form was obtained by KXAN News.\nIn addition to a pay reduction equaling 100% of the government stimulus check, the plan also called for employee pay to be reduced by 50% \"of the government distribution for any dependent that the individual claims.\" The EECP would have continued if the government eventually extended its stimulus program.\nImageNet Consulting President Pat Russell sent a statement to KXAN on March 30 apologizing for the plan, adding that the company's intent was to \"serve the greater good and protect our most vulnerable employees\" by keeping as many people employed for as long as it could.\n\"However, we understand our plan was ill-advised,\" Russell added in the statement. \"We have rescinded the potential program, and we apologize for any pain or confusion it caused.\u201d\nRELATED CONTENT\nFour Austin startups confronting COVID-19\nRelated: Four Austin startups confronting COVID-19\nCoronavirus layoffs span all industries in Austin\nRelated: Coronavirus layoffs span all industries in Austin\nABOR: Governor's order allows Realtors to show properties again\nRelated: ABOR: Governor's order allows Realtors to show properties again\nBack to Top\nAUSTIN BUSINESS JOURNAL\nHome\nNews\nLists & Leads\nPeople\nCompanies\nEvents\nStore\nSUBSCRIBERS\nStart a Subscription\nSubscriber-Only Content\nDigital Edition\nBook of Lists\nBook of Lists - Unlimited\nManage your Account\nManage My Advertising\nSubscriber Content\nABOUT & CONTACT\nAbout Us\nAbout The Business Journals\nAdvertise\nHelp & FAQs\nCirculation Sales Center Directory\nAPPS & SYNDICATION\nMobile Apps\nSyndication/RSS\nFOLLOW US\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\ninstagram\nNEWSLETTERS\nSign Up Now\nACBJ\nAmerican City Business Journals\nAmericanInno\nBizEquity\nBizLeads\nBizwomen\nHemmings\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nSite Map\n\u00a9 2024 American City Business Journals.

The average home is more than 2,400 square feet.\nWilson added solar panels, electrical hook-ups and air conditioning to the space.\nEven though he is moving out, Wilson said the dumpster will remain on campus.\n\"We are launching what we call a dumpster home school. So under that effort teachers and educators can spend a night in here. Walk home, back to the classroom with curriculum on sustainability about living on less,\" he said.\nWilson said he hopes more affordable housing options that also conserve energy can be made available worldwide, and his next plan is to work on adding a second story on the dumpster.\nClose Ad\nUS Citizens in Singapore can still vote in 2024.

At first, even members of the sustainable campus group \"Green Is The New Black\" expressed reservations.\n\"I didn't believe it at all. I'm like you're really going to live in a dumpster?\" said Huston-Tillotson University student Charles Deshaw.\nWilson calls his move an experiment in getting everyone to think tiny.\n\"To explore the whole idea of less, what happens to your life when you compact the space and the amount of stuff you have,\" Wilson said.\nWhen he first moved into the dumpster, it had no frills and looked more like camping. Now in phase two of \"The Dumpster Project,\" it feels a little more like a home.\nSo much so, that Eyewitness News reporter Steve Campion was invited to spend the night in the dumpster. He took the trip to Austin on one of the coldest days of the year, with temperatures hovering just above freezing. He had a similar experience to one of Wilson's most frightening experiences in the dumpster.\n\"The most terrifying night was the second night. It was about 27 degrees interior temperature and exactly 4:01 a.m., the trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors, a bit of a shock,\" Wilson said.\nAt the end of Campion's humble stay at the dumpster, Wilson's mission hit home.\n\"Foster a conversation and keep that conversation going. We don't know where that conversation is going to lead,\" Wilson said.\nFor now, he is only in the second phase of transforming the dumpster into the tiniest, sustainable living space.\nHis eventual goal is to use what he has learned and build the smallest home in Austin up to code.\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 KTRK-TV.

Photo courtesy of the Sunday Afternoon Project\nThe Sunday Afternoon Project, an Austin nonprofit dedicated to diversity, identity, and storytelling, is looking for a 100-person cohort to record and analyze stories about who they really are, starting in September 2024.\nIn a fun and thoughtful initiative called the Fearless Storytelling Lab, cohort members will kick things off with an interview by the co-founders, husbands Luis Gramajo and Hans Schrei, who also founded the former Austin bakery Wunderkeks.\nThe Sunday Afternoon Foundation has run storytelling workshops and talks at Google and South by Southwest, and is in talks with other large organizations about adapting the process. With Wunderkeks, the cofounders also participated in Austin's SKU incubator and participated in its pitch competition.\nAlthough Wunderkeks' cookies were delicious, the heart of its appeal was excellent branding. Customers really took the theme of being yourself to heart \u2014 especially from the gay Guatemalan immigrants \u2014 making them especially qualified to run a storytelling workshop.\nUsing each interview transcript, Gramajo and Schrei generate an objective AI analysis in the form of a fairytale, and help participants over one, four, or eight hour-long sessions to refine and share that story with the world \u2014 anywhere and as much as they want.\nIt's not really about the story, but gamifying how we talk about ourselves through abstraction: Did the story reflect what a participant really meant? Should they adopt a fun new phrasing? Or should they change how they're presenting their story to eliminate unintended implications?\n\"Going to the world and getting people to trust you is a lot about how what you say aligns with what you are,\" says Schrei, \"because otherwise the cracks are going to show. The problem that we have identified is that a lot of us don't really have that skill ... because we are told that this is the way we should talk. These are the things that we say. These are the things that we're supposed to be, as opposed to who we are.\"\nCreating the story\nGramajo is the definition of a people person. Part of Wunderkeks' success was his ability to befriend notable creatives \u2014 actor Busy Philipps, musician Dan Reynolds, and other storytellers (including your favorite CultureMap editor, who wrote about their Austin launch). His outgoing spirit and Schrei's analytical mind are the engine that push the process beyond an AI trick, into what's essentially a marketing intensive, whether participants want it for professional or personal use.\nGramajo's hour-long introductory interview is like a personality test the founders say they've developed over eight months, and all a participant has to do is answer honestly. I tried a shortened first session of the Storytelling Lab to see how it went.\nAs Gramajo and Schrei predicted, there were some things I liked, and some I would have to correct, which is what provides the arc of the course for people who go all the way.\nStory results\nStarting with the particularly apt, I enjoyed the way the program interpreted \"I write about music and food and all that.\" (Yikes..not a super eloquent start.) Pulling from more than that one underwhelming quote, it gave me the much more charming phrasing, \"In the vibrant kingdom of Austin, there lived a young sorceress named Brianna, whose magic lay not in grand illusions or powerful spells, but in her ability to distill the essence of ideas and share them with others. From an early age, Brianna felt drawn to the realm's most peculiar melodies, flavors, and stories, sensing that these were the true treasures of her homeland.\"\nOne glaring problem is that I didn't grow up in Austin, but this is actually the story doing its job of exposing our own lack of clarity; Maybe I should be bringing up my transplant status when I talk about these things.\nI was also impressed, stylistically, with how it explained some of Austin's rapid development problems, although I do wonder where it got this idea. I did say that I like to champion weirdness amid the mainstream, but the story inserted some additional specifics.\nIt said, \"As Brianna grew, she noticed that some of Austin's most unique customs were fading away, overshadowed by the glittering towers of progress.\" I suspect the AI pulled this narrative from the internet at large, where there's no shortage of complaints about glittering towers in this town.\nThe program dubbed me the \"Keeper of Curious Flames,\" which I also enjoyed, and named my life in general a \"Sanctuary of Curious Flames,\" which is increasingly true as I continue my Craigslist and junktiques devotion. I may have to remember this one and get a sign made up for my house, or something. I'll put it next to the disembodied mannequin arms I got at the City Wide Vintage Sale.\nFinally, I liked the whimsy it added to what I named as an ongoing personal challenge: how to take bolder risks while also sometimes accepting safer, more practical choices. \"Yet even as her power grew, Brianna struggled with an inner conflict: part of her longed to take greater risks, to push the boundaries of her magic further, while another part feared the chaos such actions might bring. In a moment of clarity, Brianna realized that true magic lay not in reckless action or rigid control, but in finding balance between the two.\"\nDeciding what not to share\nSomething participants should note, and the reason I'm not sharing the story in its entirety, is that it's very difficult to separate personal values from the actions of a professional team once the AI has gotten a hold of things. Because everything is organized into one metaphorical journey, there is no differentiation between the choices I make, say, at the grocery store, versus the choices I make when I log in for the day. If a participant were a vegan, but worked at a restaurant downtown, it may imply that the restaurant deals in vegan food.\nHowever, this would likely not be an issue for someone who owns their business, or anyone who is participating in the workshop with the primary intent to represent their work life. This test was, of course, an edge case, and there would be plenty of time to tweak it in the next seven sessions.\nThe first draft of the story is only meant as a launchpad for further discussions, and Schrei emphasizes that not oversharing is actually part of the training. Because of the founders' backgrounds, this is central to the organization's work. Marginalized people are often expected to answer inappropriately intimate questions about their struggles, and this workshop is about identifying what you want to share in various settings, and how \u2014 not sharing everything at once.\n\"The fact that there is a very complex truth, doesn't mean that they should be sharing every single facet of that,\" says Schrei. \"There are layers to sharing your story. ... There's a version that you're willing to share with everyone, there's a version that you're gonna share with us, and there's a version that you're gonna share with just that one or two very, very, very close people.\"\nHappily ever after\nI love my story on a personal level, and more importantly, my chat with the founders was centering and actually almost stumped me a few times. It gave me a lot to think about regarding goals and how to distill them, and I might have to hang this story on the wall somewhere in my Sanctuary of Curious Flames.\nAnyone who is interested in participating in the project can reach out to Luis Gramajo at luis@sundayafternoonproject.com and Hans Schrei at hans@sundayafternoonproject.com. The full eight-hour course costs $3,750, and four-hour courses are $1,875. The first 100 participants in either length workshop will get a 20 percent discount. Interested parties are also invited to try the first hour (detailed in this article) for $375, with no further commitment and the same discount applicable.

The average home is more than 2,400 square feet.\nWilson added solar panels, electrical hook-ups and air conditioning to the space.\nEven though he is moving out, Wilson said the dumpster will remain on campus.\n\"We are launching what we call a dumpster home school. So under that effort teachers and educators can spend a night in here. Walk home, back to the classroom with curriculum on sustainability about living on less,\" he said.\nWilson said he hopes more affordable housing options that also conserve energy can be made available worldwide, and his next plan is to work on adding a second story on the dumpster.\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nAd\nLearn More\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

He and his helpers have done a lot of work on his home for the last year, and now it must be said: He's going to miss that trash container. He confessed he teared up Tuesday night, his last in the dumpster.\n\"The last few nights have been really sweet,\" he said at the end of last week in the dumpster, which has a window air-conditioning unit, storage under a false floor, a sliding roof with a weather station that takes measurements every five minutes, and not much else.\n\"Identitywise, am I still Professor Dumpster if I'm not living in a dumpster? I don't know if this is what my mom wanted for her first-born son,\" Wilson said.\nAdvertise with us\nReport ad\nThe Dumpster Project, led by Wilson, has focused not only on sustainability and education outreach, but also the challenges and opportunities born out of living in a used \u2014 albeit thoroughly scrubbed and fumigated \u2014 36-square-foot trash bin that's been on campus and around town. After an initial phase of what was little more than camping in a dumpster, the place now has a few comforts, including a small electric heater and art on the walls. He painted the interior a sort of eggshell color to give the illusion of more space.\n\"The hypothesis we started with was that one can have a pretty good life in and on a lot less,\" Wilson told the Austin American-Statesman. \"Stuff is noise.\"\nThe hypothesis we started with was that one can have a pretty good life in and on a lot less. Stuff is noise.\n\u2013Jeff \"Professor Dumpster\" Wilson\nWilson evicted himself at a reception on campus Wednesday afternoon, and the plan now is for the dumpster to become more of a hub for education. The Dumpster Project \"Home\" School will have curriculum on sustainability. Educators will be staying in the dumpster, according to Amanda Masino, who also teaches biology at Huston-Tillotson, and students will be given a \"semiridiculous challenge: Turn the dumpster into a house. What happens when you don't have constant temperature? Where do you get water? How do you treat it?\"\n\"It's better doing it like this than talking about it in a dry way,\" Masino said.\nWilson figures he spent maybe 250 nights in the can. Other nights he was traveling, with his daughter or staying with his girlfriend.\n\"Usually when it was my place or hers, the answer was pretty definite,\" he said.\nWhen he wasn't there, it was usually occupied by students or visitors drawn to his goofy stunt with a serious purpose.\n\"It pushes your limits,\" he said. \"It totally blew up the idea of what a home is. In this climate, having central air and heat is more necessary than having a kitchen. But it would have been nice to have a toilet. The main complaint from students was a weak Wi-Fi signal \u2014 allegedly to do their homework.\"\n\"My dream,\" he said, \"is to get Google Fiber in the dumpster.\"\nAlthough he'll always be attached to the Dumpster Project, Wilson is turning to a new endeavor: spending 99 nights in a variety of homes all over Austin, whether it be at new City Council Member Greg Casar's place, a nursing home, a shotgun house on the east side, a McMansion to the west, a spot in the clouds at the Austonian and even \u2014 OK, it's an outside shot \u2014 the Governor's Mansion.\nThe new project, called 99 Nights ATX, will continue his exploration of the contemporary notion of house and home in Austin, in conventional and unconventional spaces \u2014 not to mention determine where he's going to live next. It helps that he has just a handful of shirts and a few pairs of shoes \u2014 enough to fit in a bag as he schleps around town, usually on his bike.\n\"We want a comprehensive view of the stories people tell themselves about home,\" he said. \"Housing is probably the biggest issue in Austin.\"\nThe project's website is taking nominations for housing outside of Wilson's circle of friends and associates.\nIt'll for sure be another adventure, but it'll be hard to top the dumpster.\n\"I've lived in 23 places in my life,\" Wilson said. \"This is the smallest. I know my community and my environment better. I got to know my neighbors.\"\nOne thing that may or may not change is the signoff on his email:\n\"At your disposal, Jeff.\"\n\"I may or may not keep that, but I will be litter-ally at people's disposal,\" he said.\n___\nInformation from: Austin American-Statesman, http://www.statesman.com\nThis is an AP Member Exchange shared by the Austin American-Statesman\nCopyright \u00a9 The Associated Press.

At first, even members of the sustainable campus group \"Green Is The New Black\" expressed reservations.\n\"I didn't believe it at all. I'm like you're really going to live in a dumpster?\" said Huston-Tillotson University student Charles Deshaw.\nWilson calls his move an experiment in getting everyone to think tiny.\n\"To explore the whole idea of less, what happens to your life when you compact the space and the amount of stuff you have,\" Wilson said.\nWhen he first moved into the dumpster, it had no frills and looked more like camping. Now in phase two of \"The Dumpster Project,\" it feels a little more like a home.\nSo much so, that Eyewitness News reporter Steve Campion was invited to spend the night in the dumpster. He took the trip to Austin on one of the coldest days of the year, with temperatures hovering just above freezing. He had a similar experience to one of Wilson's most frightening experiences in the dumpster.\n\"The most terrifying night was the second night. It was about 27 degrees interior temperature and exactly 4:01 a.m., the trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors, a bit of a shock,\" Wilson said.\nAt the end of Campion's humble stay at the dumpster, Wilson's mission hit home.\n\"Foster a conversation and keep that conversation going. We don't know where that conversation is going to lead,\" Wilson said.\nFor now, he is only in the second phase of transforming the dumpster into the tiniest, sustainable living space.\nHis eventual goal is to use what he has learned and build the smallest home in Austin up to code.\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 KTRK-TV.

(Photo: Jon Swartz, for USA TODAY)\nAuthor: Jon Swartz (USA TODAY , WUSA)\nPublished: 8:32 PM CDT March 19, 2017\nUpdated: 8:32 PM CDT March 19, 2017\n\"Professor Dumpster\" had just led a tour of his 352-square-foot house when the inevitable question arose: Who would be willing to plunk down $139,000 for a state-of-the-art home that small?\nJeff Wilson, a former environmental science professor who gained that moniker after living a year in a 33-square-foot dumpster here, launches into an impassioned spiel.\n\"We've been doing housing wrong for decades,\" says Wilson, who first turned his dumpster into a sustainable home in early 2014. \"We are in a housing catastrophe... the Sears home catalog was the last big innovation\" more than a century ago.\nAfter his residency in a literal dump, Wilson started Kasita (casita means \"tiny house\" in Spanish), a designer of mobile, modular homes that are stackable. The pre-fabricated homes can be constructed in three weeks \u2014 and could go a long way toward easing the affordable housing crunch that has bedeviled much of the country.\n\nWith the help of former employees at Google, Elon Musk's SolarCity and Bell Helicopter, Wilson thinks he has a solution to provide homes and stackable apartments in unused pieces of land such as vacant parking lots. \"If you file for a backyard unit, it can be approved in weeks,\" says Wilson, who predicts his homes could hit the market this summer.\n\"We need to find cracks in the system rather than take a sledgehammer to it,\" he says.\nIf the reaction of consumers at Kasita's recent party at SXSW is any indication, interest is high. Hundreds patiently waited in line to get a peek at the modular home, which features a bathroom/shower, kitchen, bedroom and living room patio.\nA remote control allows dwellers to quickly change mood lighting and an entertainment system. Date mode finds Marvin Gaye's smooth voice filling the small living area. Storage space is built into steps, walls and other nooks and crannies.\nThe 21-person start-up, based here, is not only espousing the mantra that small is beautiful, but it can be environmental and profitable. Wilson says several mayors are interested in the homes, and he intends to visit California to make his pitch this month.\n\"Green is the new black,\" Wilson says.\nClose Ad\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

And it could help change the future of housing.\nMaz Ali\n10.24.15\nHe was living in a dumpster when the idea first came to him.\nHis name's Jeff Wilson \u2014 Dr. Jeff Wilson, actually. He's a professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, known fondly on campus as \"Professor Dumpster.\"\n0 of 3 minutes, 3 seconds\n00:02\n03:03\nPhoto by Jeff Wilson/Wikimedia Commons.\nWilson made himself the guinea pig in a year-long experiment on sustainable living.\nHe traded a 3,000-square-foot home and most of his worldly possessions for a spartan 33-square-foot living space created in a big green dumpster.\nWilson's experiment eventually became a nonprofit called The Dumpster Project that \"invites learners of all ages to rethink sustainability through the quirky task of turning a dumpster into a home.\" Photos (exterior, interior) by Unilarity/Wikimedia Commons.\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Wilson said the experience made him happier than he's ever been. He was unburdened by the weights of adulthood, saving big on rent and utilities, doing less housework, cutting his commute down to near-nonexistence, and just having less stuff to clutter his space and mind.\nLiving in a dumpster may not be for everyone, but Wilson thinks smart home engineering can yield the same benefits.\nCase in point: tiny houses. They're exactly what they sound like \u2014 homes of varying tininess, often pictured in bucolic ruralities.\nPhoto by Benjamin Chun/Flickr.\nSome are craftily adapted from materials not typically used with home building.\nPhoto by ROLU/Flickr.\nAnd some are designed to go with you when you want to move.\nPhoto by Guillaume Dutilh/Wikimedia Commons.\nTiny houses are gaining more attention as a viable housing alternative, which is great news for a few reasons.\nThey're an option \u2014 for the crafty and willing \u2014 withaffordable housing growing scarcer as cities sell out their locals for higher bidders. Then there are some, like Wilson, who just want to live simpler, less materially crowded and wasteful lives.\nWilson's verve for simple living became an entrepreneurial mission \u2014 to build a new generation of smart homes.\nHis company is called Kasita, but they're not building homes for country living. They're bringing the tiny house movement to the city \u2014 although, in a press statement, they say they don't call what they're building \"tiny houses\":\n\"The Kasita completely reimagines the home with industrial design at its core. There's nothing quite like it out there. The Kasita does not contain a loft, Murphy bed, pitched roof, or wheels. It's designed from the ground up as opposed to an adaptation of an existing structure intended to store and transport merchandise (but we have lots of love and respect for our friends in the Tiny House and container communities!).\"\nTheir 208-square-foot design slides into multi-level structures called \"racks,\" which connect to municipal utilities like electricity and plumbing.\nThe first rack is scheduled to open in Austin in 2016, and plans are underway to build them in 10 more cities by 2017.\nWith Kasita, you can move your entire home to any city with a rack. All you have to do is make a call, schedule a big-rig pickup, and off it'll go to your next destination.\nKasitas are equipped with all the amenities of a modern home, including a kitchen with a cooktop, convection oven, and dishwasher; a bathroom with a walk-in shower; and a combined washer and dryer unit.\nThe walls use a special tile system that lets you customize the space to your needs.\nPlus, they'll have voice-activated components like lighting, entertainment, and a hidden queen-size bed that rolls out on your command, like a boss at bedtime.\nTo make Kasita an affordable housing opportunity, they're building community partnerships for creative land use.\nThey haven't yet announced pricing for buyers, but one of their stated goals is to offer rentals at half the market rate of standard studio apartments. In the country's most rapidly gentrifying cities, that could add up to serious savings.\nHousing may be an internationally recognized human right, but not enough is being done to ensure everyone has access to it.

And obviously when the planning has to be done for an entire family, there\u2019s even more effort needed to be put in. Imagine going through all the rigamarole of booking flights, hotels, rental cars, restaurant reservations, entertainment venues, last minute store runs for toiletries\u2026without getting so much as a \u201cthank you.\u201d\nOdds are you\u2019d be a little miffed, even if planning is your thing.\nThis was the scenario that a mom Alexis Scott found herself in after planning a summer vacation for her husband and two teen children. Thankfully, the now-viral TikTok post venting her frustrations inspired several folks to give her some much deserved support.\nIn the video, Scott began, \u201cI'm on a family vacation right now with my two teenagers and my husband. We flew in late last night. We think we got in at like 12:15 a.m. and headed to get a rental car and then got to our Airbnb. And I am frustrated.\u201d\nScott had tried and tried to get any input from her family about what they might want to do, and each time got the same reply: \u201c\u2018Whatever you want, mom. I don't care. Okay. I don't care.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Glad I'm planning this vacation for everybody to not care,\u201d Scott lamented.\nStill, she did the planning\u2014cause someone had to do it. But as soon as the vacation started, all her decisions were met with complaints. From being called \u201ccheap\u201d for getting too small of an SUV rental car to being told \u201cMom is never going to be in charge of booking the Airbnb again. She can't even this, that and the other,\u2019\u201d after the family found out their AirBnb was three stories with quite a few stairs.\n\u201cThen this morning, we wake up and it's an urban setting. We live in a very quiet suburban setting and my husband's saying how he barely slept and this and that. And I'm just like, enough!\u201d she said.\nAll of this happened within the first 24 hours of the trip. It\u2019s easy to see why Scott needed to vent.\nHer video concluded with:\nI have been the only one to put in all the effort in planning this trip. And I know there's videos on mental load, but this is prime time example of me. I'm shouldering the mental load for my entire family and everybody has something to say about it. So, yeah, I'm frustrated. Please pray for me that we can all turn our attitudes around and have a great day.\u201d\nDown in the comments, viewers could totally empathize with Scott for feeling burnt out and disappointed.\n\u201cOh gosh the mental load of planning every detail and then knowing is something goes wrong or isn't\u2019 perfect it\u2019s all on you. Been there,\u201d one person shared.\nAnother added, \u201cI tell my husband that I haven\u2019t been on vacation since I was a child and he\u2019s alway confused bc to him, \u2018we\u2019 go on vacation every year. Only other moms would understand what I mean.\u201d\nMany suggested that she do something for herself instead.\n\u201cJust Irish goodbye one morning, go to brunch alone, hit the spa or a pool and come home after dinner,\u201d one person wrote.\n\u201cGo and do whatever you want to do!! Spa day sounds perfect and take yourself out for fabulous meals!!\u201d echoed another.\nOn a positive note: this story does have a happy ending. In a follow-up video, Scott shared how she showed her family the TikTok video she made, and it did turn things around.\n\n\u201cWe have actually had a really, really great day today,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone has had positive attitudes. I've heard a lot of thank yous and my kids have been buying their little side purchases with their own money and not even asking me to pay for it... but they have been really self-sufficient in that space.\u201d\nAll in all, Scott recognizes that her family is \u201chuman,\u201d and a big part of being human is apologizing when a mistake is made and moving forward.\n\u201cWe love each other. This was a learning experience.\u201d\nBy the way, Scott's entire TikTok is dedicated to relatable mom content.

But it seems to be that the snacks are what causes people to feel most upset when that nostalgia kicks in. Maybe it's because as you age you no longer play with toys and aren't very interested in tween shows from the 80s or 90s, those sorts of things are expected to go away.\nFoods and snacks on the other hand really crank up the fond memories because they're things you can taste and smell. You remember them with all of your senses. So when someone asked what discontinued food do you still mourn, more than 30k people had something to add to the list. Here are some of the most requested:\n1. SoBe Drinks\nThe \"lizard drink\" 90s kids just couldn't get enough of. Technically, you can still find the drinks in very few places, they're just extremely difficult to locate and have been since early 2021 according to Mashed. One person wrote in the Reddit thread that Washington state has them in select areas, prompting one person to reply, \"please tell me where you've seen it, I live in Western WA and have not seen it in years. I am willing to drive literally hours for a sobe.\" Apparently grocery stores in Kenmore, Washington carry the 90s drink or you can buy them in bulk from the PepsiCo website supposedly.\n2. McDonald's Box Cookies\nIn a far, far away time in the late 1900s, McDonald's used to carry delicious little boxes of cookies with McDonald's characters on the boxes. They came in similar boxes to old school animal crackers but the formula for those cookies were nothing short of delicious. Then the restaurant giant stopped carrying them after the mid 90s before bringing them back in the 2000s but in a small bag. They're gone again, now everyone has the sads.\n\"Those McDonaldland cookies were the only thing that got me through my first pregnancy. Just the smell of them would make the morning sickness fade. I miss them,\" one person shares.\n\n3. Flintstones Push-Ups\nThose push-ups were delicious and clearly orange was the superior flavor. Even though the ice cream treat was designed to be contained in the tube, you always wound up sticky with orange juices running down your arm and face. The paper tube was notorious for starting to disintegrate before you were able to get to the bottom. One person admitted that the treat was the one thing she knew would make her feel better while sick, \"I was sick last week and my boyfriend asked what he could get me and I blurted out...\"push-pops.\" I had no idea where it came from, but my soul knew. It remembered.\"\n4. Orbitz drink\nThe drink that looked like a lava lamp with little flavored beads that bursted like boba. Orbitz wasn't around very long and maybe the fact that it did look like a decorative lamp had something to do with it but still people miss the non-carbonated drink. It came onto the market in 1996 and was gone by 1998. Someone suggested with the popularity of boba, Clearly Canadian may be able to pull off a comeback for the nostalgic drink, \"Yes! I thought of the \"lava lamp drinks\". I think these would do better now with the popularity of boba. They were just too far ahead of their time.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia\n5. Carnation Instant Breakfast Bars\nApparently people have strong feelings about the discontinuation about these bars with more than one person cursing Nestle for the demise of the bar. Someone enthusiastically agrees the bars should've stayed around, \"I'm not the only one!!!!!!!!!! Those things were amazing. They tasted good and were actually filling. Whoever decided to stop making those was a moron. They really need to bring those back.\"\n6. Yogos\nThese delicious balls of childhood memories were apparently a choking hazard but it didn't stop people from eating them. Was it the risk of aspiration that caused the company to pull the plug on the yogurt covered treat? \"My kid almost choked to death on one of these back in like 03-04. They were real good tho...,\" one person shares. According to commenters Costco has a dupe called Yoggies that tastes similarly to Yogos.\n\nSome other popular mentions were Altoids Tangerine Sours, Blue Pepsi, Crystal Pepsi and Fruit Stripe Gum. People are demanding that some of these things return so they can continue their nostalgic journey with the real thing in hand. While there's no plans to petition companies, at least people know they're not alone in their longing for long lost snacks.\nFrom Your Site Articles\nThe 'Last Gen X playground' has been found, and people can't contain their nostalgia \u203a\nDad's TikTok for son showing what his 80s childhood was like is ... \u203a\nPeople are sharing the \u201990s trends they totally want back and it\u2019s an oasis of nostalgia \u203a\nNOSTALGIC PRODUCTS\nEDUCATION\nMom shares how her first grader's homework on the second day of school broke his spirit\n\"It's breaking their spirit and it robs them of what little fun and family time they have when they come home after a long day of school.\"\nAnnie Reneau\n08.22.24\nPhoto credit: Cassi Nelson/Facebook\nHow much homework is too much homework?\nDebates about homework are nothing new, but the ability of parents to find support for homework woes from thousands of other parents is a fairly recent phenomenon.\nA mom named Cassi Nelson shared a post about her first grader's homework and it quickly went viral. Nelson shared that her son had come home from his second day of school with four pages of homework, which she showed him tearfully working on at their kitchen counter.\n\"He already doesn\u2019t get home from school until 4pm,\" she wrote. \"Then he had to sit still for another hour plus to complete more work. I had to clear out the kitchen so he could focus. His little legs kept bouncing up and down, he was bursting with so much energy just wanting to go play. Then he broke my heart when he looked up at me with his big teary doe eyes and asked\u2026. 'Mommy when you were little did you get distracted a lot too?!' Yes sweet baby, mommy sure did too! I don\u2019t know how ppl expect little children to sit at school all day long and then ALSO come home to sit and do MORE work too\u2026.\"\nNelson tells Upworthy that she was \"shocked\" that kindergarteners and first graders have homework, much less the amount they were expected to do. \"We didn't have homework like this when we were in these younger grades.\"\nExpert opinion and research is somewhat mixed on the homework front, but there isn't any conclusive evidence that homework is universally beneficial for students and too much homework can actually be harmful. As a standard, the National Education Association (NEA) and the National Parent Teacher Association (NPTA) support a limit on homework of \u201c10 minutes of homework per grade level.\"\nWith that as a guide, a first grader shouldn't have more than 10 minutes of homework on any given school day, but it's not unusual for young kids to have two or three times the recommended limit of homework. That can be stressful for both kids and parents, cutting into valuable family time and limiting kids' time to decompress, play and freely engage in imaginative activity.\nAs Nelson concluded, \"It\u2019s breaking their spirit and it robs them of what little fun and family time they have when they come home after a long day of school.\"\nMost parents and even most teachers in the comments agreed with her that four pages of homework is too much for a first grader, especially on only the second day of school:\n\"Poor little man. Children below a certain grade should not be given homework! Small children have a hard time sitting still for a long period of time yet alone expected to sit and do hours of homework, for what??? They are SMALL CHILDREN! Let them snack, play, laugh and all the other fun things when they get home. You are only a child once, they don't need that taken away from them. Let them embrace their inner creativity, imagination, recipes, etc.\"\n\"This breaks my spirit. Our schools are huge scams. You're exactly right Cassi. Homework is ridiculous. Kids til the age of 10 primarily learn through real life situations and play scenarios.\"\n\"I hate that for him! My little one has ADHD and doing homework after sitting in class all day is very stressful to him and makes him hate school. They are in school for 7 hours they shouldn\u2019t have homework. That definitely takes away any kind of family time and that\u2019s why kids never spend time with parents anymore because they have all this homework to do after being gone all day.I feel that if it can\u2019t be done in the 7 hours they have the kids then it should wait until the next school day.\"\n\"I don\u2019t make them do homework at home when they are that little. It\u2019s not fair!They are at school allllll day! And it\u2019s already sooooo much for their little bodies and brains! I\u2019ve never had a teacher upset about it either.. and even if I did oh well!\"\n\"That breaks my heart. 4 pages is absolutely ridiculous for young kids. My daughter is going into 2nd grade next month, the 2 years in school it was always 1 page of homework sometimes back and front if it was math. And to read.\"\n\"I was in this boat with my son\u2026conversation with the principal and teachers helped dramatically!! It\u2019s too much and we have to advocate for them.\"\nNelson was blown away by the response to her post, which has been shared on Facebook over 89,000 times. \"I NEVER thought me sharing my thoughts openly about how my heart hurt watching my little guy struggle would connect to so many others worldwide going through the same thing,\" she says.\nMany parents shared that excessive homework is one of the reasons they decided to homeschool their children, which Nelson took to heart. The week after sharing her viral homework post, she shared that they had had their first day of homeschooling. It was \"A HUGE SUCCESS!!!!\" she wrote, with her son getting far more work done in a far shorter amount of time, sitting for classes for just 1 hour and 45 minutes total.\nNelson tells Upworthy she was totally intimidated to try homeschooling. \"I seriously thought there was no way,\" she says. \"But I knew I had to set my fear aside and just take the leap for my kids. I told myself I'd figure it out one way or another. And here we are three days in and it's been the easiest and best choice I've ever made.\"\nHomeschooling is not going to the right solution for every family, however, so the question of homework remains an important issue for kids, parents, teachers and schools to work out.\nFrom Your Site Articles\nSecond-grade teacher shares unique homework policy and it has parents sighing with relief \u203a\nAn Irish school is ditching homework for a month, assigning 'acts of kindness' instead \u203a\nAs a teacher, I used to give tons of homework.

It gets worse when some of these young whipper-snappers think they know more about the event than those alive when it happened.\nGen Xers, those born approximately between 1965 and 1980, lived through many pivotal moments in history, including the end of the Vietnam War, the Challenger disaster, the War on Terror, the AIDS epidemic, the contested 2000 election, 9/11, the election of Barack Obama, the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan, the death of Kurt Cobain and the OJ Simpson murder trial.\nSo, it\u2019s funny for people in their 40s and 50s to be lectured by a Gen Zer (those born between 1997 and 2012) about moments they saw firsthand. A few years back, an X user named SameOldStay brought the issue to the attention of many Gen Xers in a viral tweet.\n\nRecently, a group of Redditors on the Gen X forum took up the cause. People started sharing the times when young people tried to lecture them about historical moments that they never lived through but most likely heard about on TikTok.\n1. Don't tell me about 9/11\n\"I was an airline pilot on 9/11 flying from Atlanta to LaGuardia. Don't f**k with me, younglings.\"\n\"A younger Millennial once insisted to me that we dial 911 for emergencies in honor of the victims of 9/11.\"\n2. Gen Z OJ takes\n\"My oldest kid told me how OJ Simpson may not have killed his ex-wife, and the matching DNA was likely his son Jason. Listen here, I didn\u2019t watch court TV for 6 weeks and read 20 books on the case to have you lecture me about a 10-second TikTok clip that 'solved' the crime of the century!! You don\u2019t even know who Kato is!\"\n3. Rose-colored glasses\n\u201c'In 1986, you could work part-time at a yogurt shop in LaJolla, CA and afford a 3 bedroom home on the ocean.' No. Parts of this country have always been super expensive to live in.\"\n\"I admit to getting tired of hearing how easy it was for me to get through college and such 25ish years ago. I also remember the 70s and 80s, and amazingly, my parents could not afford a giant house with one person working as a coffee shop attendant.\"\n\"Every generation has some hardships, and today's young people have been screwed over in some ways, but they go way overboard with how easy it was for everyone before them.\"\n4. Why are they arguing?\n\"I teach middle school and have had this happen. Kids are arguing with me, and I\u2019m like, 'See this little crack in the floorboard? I was literally standing on it RIGHT HERE while watching this happen LIVE on TV.'\"\n\"Younger people, kids, and most people in general now, have super easy, fast access to information, right or wrong. They usually don't ask people who've actually lived through it, they just swipe and click and choose the information that is more shocking or in line with whatever ideas they already have about the event.\"\n\n\n5. Culture isn't that homogenous\n\"The most common one I see is from younger writers proclaiming that 'The entire country was up in arms about [insert major event]'... I was there, the reality is that most of the country didn't really care either way, but a few hundred protestors made a lot of noise.\"\n\"It\u2019s the same with the past. Like the roaring \u201820s. Everyone thinks the flappers and the whole F. Scott Fitzgerald vibe was everywhere when all of that was actually a smaller set of people.\"\n6. The Iraq war\n\"Someone was explaining how we had to invade Iraq to find the people who did 9/11. It was just too much for me to even try.\"\n\"Close, close friend of mine was killed in Iraq (with me there). At the funeral, his son accepted the flag the military presents to the next of kin. The photo became really famous. Had a Gen Zer tell the picture was staged by the military as military propaganda (without realizing how dumb the thought of the military spreading pictures of crying 7-year-olds in an attempt to improve their image, is). I tried showing them pictures, etc to show the family is real. She responded by saying I was one of 'those.'\"\n7. Nuclear bomb drills\n\"I've had people tell me I'm making up the nuclear bomb drills we did in elementary school in the 80s.\"\n8. History-challenged\n\"I was chaperoning my daughter\u2019s trip to Washington DC. The Millennial tour guide said he was going to take the kids to see the Challenger Space Shuttle.\"\n9. No, Communism isn't great\n\"Imagine being a person who grew up in former soviet union listening to young people talk about the benefits of communism.\"\n\n\n10. Haunted Mansion history\n\"I was chaperoning a trip to Disney, and one of the teens confidently told me The Haunted Mansion ride was based on the movie with Eddie Murphy. She was wondering why Eddie Murphy didn\u2019t appear in the ride. The other Gen Xer I was with explained the ride came first, like Pirates of the Caribbean.\"\n11. AIDS was very, very, very bad\n\"I had someone tell me that AIDS wasn\u2019t a big deal because well 'they had drugs for that.' I literally said to them I need you to shut up right now because you\u2019re looking like the most stupid person in the planet right now. Pulled out old Google and showed them how many people died, why, and how horrid it was. Like I had friends who died.\"\n12. The attitude is the problem\n\"This happened to me yesterday. It wasn't so much that this zygote was wrong, it was how obnoxiously arrogant and condescending he was about it.\"\n13. Y2K wasn't a big deal\n\"My favorite is the retconned Y2K they had to \u2018live through.'\"\n\"Yeah, I don't recall Y2K being taken seriously by the masses.\"\nFrom Your Site Articles\nSomeone asked Twitter, \u2018What's the most Gen X thing you ever did?\u2019 and the responses were awesome. \u203a\nGen X has hit 'that stage' of life and is not handling it very well \u203a\nGen X values that need to come back - Upworthy \u203a\nGEN X\nPOP CULTURE\nJennifer Garner's 'nerdy farm facts' about pumpkins is delightfully educational\nThe overalls \ud83d\ude0d\nHeather Wake\n08.26.24\n@jennifer.garner/Instagram\nJennifer Garner can talk about pumpkins with us all day, everyday.\nMove over PSLs. The new mark of fall is Jennifer Garner sharing \u201cnerdy farm facts\u201d from her very own pumpkin patch.\nIn an adorable video posted to her Instagram, the \u201c13 Going on 30\u201d actress sported dungarees and a sun hat while holding a large yellow flower (spoiler alert: it\u2019s a soon-to-be pumpkin) and educating us all on how pumpkins grow.\n\u201cThis flower is both male and female. There\u2019s a pistol inside and it needs the pollen,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you know who takes care of that? Bees! Thank you for the bees!\u201d\nContinuing her delightful and informative spiel, Garner tried to hold up the flower to show where the pollen from said bees might fall inside it. However, the wind kept the flower from exposing itself in such a way.\n\u201cOh\u2026she\u2019s shy\u2026\u201d Garner quipped.\nOnce pollen does reach inside the pistol, \u201cthe miracle continues.\u201d Garner then held the flower sideways to show what looked like the botanical version of a pregnant belly, and said, \u201cThis is when you get the email that says, \u2018Congratulations, Mama Pumpkin. Your baby is the size of a large grape.'\"\nAs Garner explained, this is when the seedling \u201ckeeps growing and growing,\u201d to the point where the flower portion will eventually \u201ccurl and dry off.\u201d\nPicking up a full formed pumpkin still growing on a vine, she added that, \u201cit\u2019s like a little umbilical cord, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nCut to Garner holding up two small green pumpkins, joking that they are \u201ca nice size b.\u201d\nWatch Jennifer Garner\u2019s \u2018Nerdy Farm Facts\u2019 video now:\nDown in the comments, viewers were bee-yond happy with Garner\u2019s pumpkin presentation.\n\u201c\ud83c\udf83 \ud83d\udc1d This cracks me up (and so informative!),\u201d one person wrote.\nAnother echoed, \u201cWell done!

Recipe courtesy of Homesick Texan below:\nSquash Blossom Quesadilla Recipe\nIngredients\n1 poblano pepper\n24 squash blossoms, stems and stamens removed.\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1/2 half medium-yellow onion, diced\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon dried epazote (can substitute with 1/4 fresh cilantro)\n1/4 teaspoon kosher\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n1 1/2 pounds (6 cups) Oaxacan, Monterey Jack, or Muenster cheese, grated\n12 corn or flour tortillas\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter\nSalsa verde, for serving\nInstructions\nPut the poblano under the broiler for about 10 minutes, turning once until it blackens. Place in a plastic bag, close it and let it sit for about 20 minutes. After this time has passed, take poblano out of the bag, peel it (skin should shred off easily), remove stem and seeds and dice.\nGently wash the squash blossoms (there might be bugs inside) and remove stems and stamens. Roughly chop.\nHeat skillet to medium and add the olive oil. Add onions and diced poblano and cook for about 5 minutes or until onions are translucent.\nAdd garlic, epazote, squash blossoms, salt, and pepper and saut\u00e9 for 10 minutes or until all the liquid from the flowers has evaporated. Remove from heat and set squash-blossom filling aside. Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed.\nIn a skillet heated to medium, melt a tablespoon of butter. Add a tortilla and cook it on one side until it puffs (about 30 seconds). Flip tortilla over and sprinkle over entire surface 1/4 cup of squash blossom filling and 1/2 cup of grated cheese.\nTop with another tortilla, and after cheese has melted and the 2 tortillas stick together (a couple of minutes), flip quesadilla and cook for a couple of minutes more or until lightly browned.\nRepeat for the remainder of the filling and tortillas. Serve warm with salsa verde on the side, if you like.\nSounds like a great recipe for Garner to try on her \u201cPretend Cooking Show.\u201d It\u2019s sure to be utterly wholesome and entertaining, just like everything else she does.\nFrom Your Site Articles\nJennifer Garner shares the deeply thoughtful reason she would like to go to divinity school \u203a\nJennifer Garner overwhelmed by the friendship bracelets she received at a Taylor Swift concert \u203a\nJennifer Garner's 'embarrassing' reveal of items in her bag is delightfully unhinged \u203a\nJOY\nGet stories worth sharing delivered to your inbox\nEmail Address\nBy signing up you agree to Upworthy's privacy policy.\nTrending Stories\nMODERN FAMILIES\nMom explains the common Boomer parenting style that still affects many adults today\nTIKTOK\nAirbnb host has world riveted over stolen painting that was replaced inside her own home\nSCIENCE\nThe oldest whales on the planet are more ancient than 'Moby-Dick' and have the harpoons to prove it\nGEN Z AGING\nMillennial shares 'proof' they've set the new standard for what it looks like to age\nJENNIFER GARNER\nJennifer Garner works with paparazzo to create an act of kindness for homeless man\nHOUSING\nMan figured out how to beat squatters at their own game.

CNET Road Trip 2014 dives in.\nDaniel Terdiman\nJuly 1, 2014 4:00 a.m. PT\n7 min read\nJeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, demonstrates how he makes his bed in his 33-square-foot home -- inside a dumpster in Austin, Texas.\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nAUSTIN, Texas -- When you cross Bill Nye the Science Guy with Oscar the Grouch, you end up with a high-energy, charismatic character who is hoping to help change the world by living in a dumpster.\nMeet Professor Dumpster, the university dean who's currently in the middle of spending a year with a glorified trash container as his home.\nIn Austin, Prof. Dumpster lives the good life (pictures)\n+17 More\nSee all photos\nThis, of course, isn't your everyday dumpster, filled with garbage and smelling like week-old fish. Professor Dumpster, whose real name is Jeff Wilson, and who teaches environmental sciences at the historically African-American Huston Tillotson University here, has outfitted the dumpster he's lived in since February with some of the niceties of civilized living: a couple of lights, stow-away clothing, and even a bed with the \"Star Wars\" sheets he had as a kid.\nBut the list of niceties halts abruptly when it comes to things that require even the average amount of energy or water used, or the amount of waste generated, in a typical American household. This is an off-the-grid home meant to help people understand just how unsustainable the average American lifestyle is.\nI've come to Austin, the capital of Texas, as part of CNET Road Trip. Though I've been spending day after day at Naval bases, with the Air Force, and at a large airline headquarters, this visit to Wilson's 33-square-foot home seems to me to have every bit the national and international impact. As he puts it on the Dumpster Project's official Web site, \"What does home look like in a world of 10 billion people? How do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices? [The] dumpster will transform from a barely habitable used garbage container to a sustainable house and interactive teaching lab.\"\nMr. Minimalist\nThough this is the first time Wilson has lived in a dumpster, it's not his first shot at living minimally. A few years ago, when he got divorced, he began the slow process that eventually led him here. He moved into an 800-square-foot apartment, and when that lease ended, he sold almost everything he owned, and started living out of his University of Texas at Brownsville office.\nBut that was boring. He wanted to take his minimalism further. This is a man who met his current girlfriend on OkCupid and convinced her that their first date should be a three-week, eight-country adventure in which neither brought anything more than what they were wearing. Sound like a great story? New Line Cinema, the film production company, thought so. It has optioned the rights to the book his girlfriend, Clara Bensen, is writing based on the article about the date she penned for Salon.com.\nOne day in November 2012, sitting in a Starbucks, Wilson gazed out at the parking lot, and saw a dumpster. \"I called my most sane friend,\" Wilson remembered, \"and said, 'look, I want to move into a dumpster and do a project on it.' I was hoping she'd talk me out of it.\"\nHer reaction was this instead: \"It's on. Let's roll.\"\nEnergetic and charismatic\nBack in Austin, it's easy to see why a wide range of people, from students to building design experts, have flocked to help Wilson realize his dream. Though he looks like a prototype nerd -- with thick glasses, an Oscar the Grouch baseball hat, and an overall Pee Wee Herman style about him, he's engaging, funny, and charismatic. He's also passionate about helping people understand that less can very much be more.\nHere's the thing, he'll argue: An average load of laundry uses 40 gallons of water. Toasters are incredible power hogs. Air conditioning is both inefficient and bad for the environment. And just think about all the waste Americans generate every day.\nMore adventures from Road Trip 2014\nCheck out the latest from Daniel's trip to the best tech spots in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and more.\nHow Air Force One's communications are 'hardened'\nChasing drug-laden 'bogeys' across the skies\nWhen they say fly, wanna-be Navy pilots say 'how high?'\nThis robot can take the weight off soldiers' shoulders\nRoad Trip 2014 roundup\nFollow Dan on Twitter\nWith the Dumpster Project, Wilson and his team want to show it's possible to live comfortably and safely with far less impact on the environment. Personally, though, he's taking it even further than most: He wants to show it's possible to have a home in the middle of a major American city using just 1 percent of the energy and water as does the average household.\nFew would recognize Wilson's home -- which he tries to sleep in as much as six times a week, taking nights off when he's got his daughter, or when he stays over at his girlfriend's -- as offering the kinds of comforts most of us consider normal. There's no TV. There's no sink. There's no furniture. There's not even a bathroom. There are however, a couple of LED lights, one of which is solar-powered with a built-in iPhone charger.\nWilson doesn't try to deny that he's able to pursue this project because his (huge) university office, complete with air conditioning, an iMac, and several comfy chairs, is about 100 yards away, and because the school also has bathrooms and other services of which he avails himself. He also frequently spends time in nearby hotel lobbies reading and even napping, and he gets his drinking and cooking water by pulling a 24-gallon barrel known as a Hippo Roller, an hour each way to Lady Bird Lake.\nYet the point is still relevant: He sleeps most nights in the dumpster, wakes up, makes coffee, and spends a whole lot more time in it than you'd think was possible. \"I spend as much time in here as I would in my normal home,\" Wilson said, adding that \"I'm a homeowner in Austin, and I have the shortest commute in Austin.\"\nPart of his commitment to the project stems from the fact that there's a lot of people who have been inspired by it, mostly kids. He's been giving about a talk a week at different schools, and the interest children have for the project is reflected in many of the amusing drawings of the dumpster he's been given, and which he now has up on the interior of the dumpster's west-facing wall.\nIn August, Professor Dumpster will also install a bit of luxury: a set of home appliances that he'll run for a few months in an attempt to establish a baseline of how much water and energy those machines -- a fridge, a washer and dryer, and others -- use. That will then be his comparison point. Of course, he'll probably have a hard time letting go of the machines.\n'It's an outlier'\nIt's clear that Huston Tillotson University is very much behind Project Dumpster, even though Wilson, who was hired only last year, didn't initially tell the school about the initiative. But the project has brought the small university -- which is older than the nearby University of Texas at Austin, but clearly in that giant school's shadow -- a lot of notoriety, despite its being so outside the norm of typical American life. \"It's an outlier, and outliers get attention,\" Wilson said. \"We would never expect anyone to be insane enough to live in a 33-square-foot dumpster.\"\nIn fact, Wilson's goals are pretty abstract. He's trying to come up with lessons on design and building dense housing that can be used in cities like Austin. He believes if he can live comfortably in a dumpster, he can help people understand how to live well in 120-square-foot studio apartments. \"You could solve a lot of transportation and energy problems\" if people lived more densely in cities, Wilson argued.\nLuckily, no one is breathing down his neck, demanding he meet preset milestones. Though Project Dumpster has an official timeline, which lays out its growth and educational expectations through 2015, he's got a lot of freedom. \"We're thoughtfully playing,\" he said, \"to where we don't have hard design deadlines or carved-in-stone blueprints for what a dumpster home would look like. It's an evolution.\"\n'I'm pretty darned happy'\nAs Wilson sits on a small bench outside the dumpster, the project's flourishing garden just a few feet away, he looks pretty content. Dressed in a khaki shirt and pants, but wearing coordinated green sneakers and the Oscar the Grouch cap, he's relaxed as he heats up water for Turkish Coffee on a small propane burner.\nI asked him what had surprised him most about his experience living in the dumpster. After thinking for a moment, he said, \"What's most surprising is I'm pretty darned happy.\"\nHe's also become an expert in sizing up any space he visits -- so when he walks into any closet or bathroom he automatically starts doing space calculations.\nThe hardest thing about the project may even have had more to do with climate than space. Americans are used to living in 72-degree environments, he said. So in the early months of living in the dumpster, he had trouble sleeping when temperatures inside rose even to 75 degrees. But gradually, as summer has begun, he's gotten comfortable as the mercury rises. Now, even when it's 81 degrees inside, he's not hot.\nYet this is Texas, and it is summer. Though it's been temperate so far, it's unlikely to stay so. Can he stick it out? \"I want to get to triple digits in here,\" Wilson said, \"before I wuss out.\"\nKeep an eye out for more behind-the-scenes stories and photo galleries as I travel throughout Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kansas during this year's Road Trip. I'll seek out most interesting technology, military, aviation, architecture, and other destinations our country has to offer.

With the creation of this dumpster home, I was not only communicating with my students but also to broader public. Putting a comfortable home and a dirty dumpster into one gets folks talking.\u201d\nWilson expanded on the dumpster idea and moved towards a \u201cmicrounit\u201d project. Along with several other designers and innovaters, he started a company called Kasita, a startup that addresses Austin housing inequality by creating tiny, affordable housing.\nFind out what's happening in East Austinwith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nSubscribe\nKasita, a play on the Spanish word \u201ccasita,\u201d which means \u201clittle house,\u201d is what Wilson\u2019s company is using to make this company real. Wilson and his team create homes that are only 208 square feet, yet include all of the necessary amenities for the average apartment owner.\n\u201cI started thinking about the best parts of the dumpster. By living smaller and being more nimble, I was able to have freedom to move my house wherever I wanted, while also having a short term lease. I could own stuff rather than it owning me. I started thinking about what if we made something bigger than a dumpster, but made it micro. I wanted to keep it nimble enough where you could move it as you would a dumpster. I literally created a \u2019dumpster baby\u2019\u201d.\nWilson\u2019s has a stellar team to help the company grow. Elon Musk\u2019s head industrial designer at Solar City, W2 MacFab\u2019s Robert Keith, and micro-unit developer Taylor Wilson all make up Wilson\u2019s dream team, and help make the innovative project a reality.\nThe living room couch pulls out into a queen-size bed, storage units and closets are built into the walls, and a step next to the couch serves a dual purpose by also storing up to 50 pairs of shoes. The walls in the units are made of tiles that can hold speakers and shelves, and the units themselves can fit into rack structures. Each rack holds up to nine units, and you can fit one rack into an area as small as 1,000 feet.\nKasita has two lots in Downtown Austin that will be ready by 2016. By 2017, Kasita plans to expand to 10 cities across the country.\n[Photo: Kasita]\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

The Dumpster Project is all a part of Wilson\u2019s new course on low-impact living and the Huston Tillotson University\u2019s new green campus initiative, reports Treehugger. Wilson will begin his year in the six-foot-wide dumpster later this fall.\nThe dumpster, roughly one percent the size of an average new American home, will be outfitted with pioneering systems and be totally self-reliant. The unit will use solar panels for power and innovative systems for things like water filtration, climate control, and energy-producing toilets. Wilson\u2019s students will track and study the modified dumpster throughout the year.\nThe project has loftier goals than \u201cjust a one-guy-in-a-dumpster deal,\u201d Wilson told Fast Company. Eventually, Wilson\u2019s goal is to tour the project across the country and share his K-12 curriculum using the dumpster as a model.\nProfessor Dumpster, Wilson\u2019s unofficial title, said \u201cMy ex-wife did not express a lot of encouragement in our [6-year-old] daughter sleeping with daddy in a dumpster \u2026 So that\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d\nFiled to:\nNews\nLead Photo: Courtesy of the Dumpster Project\nPopular on Outside Online\nJOIN OUTSIDE+\nEnjoy coverage of racing, history, food, culture, travel, and tech with access to unlimited digital content from Outside Network's iconic brands.\nLEARN MORE\nADVERTISE PRIVACY POLICY CONTACT CAREERS TERMS OF USE LICENSING & ACCOLADES DIGITAL ARCHIVES SITE MAP GEAR UP GIVE BACK\nHEALTHY LIVING\nCLEAN EATING\nOXYGEN\nVEGETARIAN TIMES\nYOGA JOURNAL\nOUTDOOR\nBACKPACKER\nCLIMBING\nFLY FISHING FILM TOUR\nGAIA GPS\nNATIONAL PARK TRIPS\nOUTSIDE\nOUTSIDE TV\nSKI\nWARREN MILLER\nENDURANCE\nBETA MTB\nFASTEST KNOWN TIME\nPINKBIKE\nTRAILFORKS\nTRAIL RUNNER\nTRIATHLETE\nVELO\nWOMEN'S RUNNING\nINDUSTRY\nATHLETEREG\nBICYCLE RETAILER & INDUSTRY NEWS\nFINISHERPIX\nNASTAR\nOUTSIDE EVENTS CYCLING SERIES\nOUTSIDE SHOP\n\u00a9 2024 Outside Interactive, Inc",

What is this experiment trying to prove? That a human being can allegedly \u201clive\u201d in 33 sq.ft.? A prison cell has at least 88 square feet and that\u2019s called \u201cinhuman\u201d by some people. I\u2019m from Chicago, home of politicians doing these sort of stunts to \u201cBe ONE with the Po\u2019 Folks!\u201d and it makes news for a while and then things return to normal. Whether it\u2019s the former Mayor Byrne moving from her Gold Coast residence to Da\u2019 Hood (Cabrini Green Housing Projects) to our current Governor Quinn who is going to live on a \u201c\u2026poor person\u2019s minimum wages for a week\u201d, I\u2019ve never been sure WHAT lasting effects these stunts create.\nAnd, if \u201cProfessor Dumpster \u2122\u201d aka Professor Jeff Wilson wasn\u2019t trying so utterly, completely, epically HARD to be Tragically Hip, I\u2019d give him at least passing credit for attempting something \u201cRadical.\u201d\nLet\u2019s do a check list of Professor Hipster\u2019s wardrobe:\n1) Indiana Jones Fedora Hat.

Final Check off of Classic Hipster Wardrobe, Check!\nWould anyone even recognize the attention-starved professor if he dressed\u2026gasp!\u2026normal? Or restricted his props to just a couple instead of the entire costume department?\nExcept for the sheer experimentation aspect of this project where the students are all \u201cYou GO!, Prof Dumpster\u201d and then bugger off to their OWN 2,500 square foot homes that their parents own, I see no value in this silliness. How much cooler would it have been for Professor Hipster to actually come up with a project that the poor and homeless would actually want to abide in until their fortune\u2019s or luck turned around? I can\u2019t imagine a single sole wanting to call this place \u201cHome\u201d.\nAs it stands, only Professor Dumpster and Oscar The Grouch prefer to LIVE in a Dumpster! pffffffffttt\u2026.\nREPLY LINK\nPaul\nSeptember 16, 2014, 6:19 pm\n\u2026or more concisely, stupidity knows no bounds.\nI agree with you Cahow.

Before I even began my rant, I was privately thinking, \"This man has NO LIFE outside of his students!\" He couldn't, just couldn't. Straight or gay, if you're in a relationship, NO Significant Other is going to come over for a boot knockin' in your Dumpster \u2122! (well, unless they're into total kink but that would probably involve a used Dumpster \u2122!) LOL\nThis is what I'm expecting next from Mr. Hipster Dumpster \u2122: \"Professor Living Simply in SIX SQUARE FEET!\"\nAnd what we'll all be gifted to view is the Professor living on a park bench under a Blue Tarp, extolling the virtues of \"living simply and mortgage free!\" The 6 sq.ft. comes into play because it's the 1' x 6' dimensions of the Hipster's body. \"See how easy it is to move from place to place,\" he'll crow! \"I can pick up and move anytime I want!\" (or when the Po'-Po' move his bum from the park bench!) Of course, he'll also have to have an add-on campaign about \"Look how much food is tossed into this park bin! What a waste!\", and we'll be treated to him noshing on someone's left over Panini and flat soda drink. (blech!)\nAnd since he's the Hippest of the Hipster Dumpster \u2122 Proff's, he should include several Selfies of himself, wrapped up in his keen Blue Tarp and dining upon his purloined bin 'treats'.\nI've been involved in Environmental and Global Movements since Paul Ehrlich, Ralph Nader, and Cesar Chavez and still do, to this day as do our adult children.

Usually, you and I are in complete accord on the homes that you list but this time, respectfully, I\u2019ll have to \u201cAgree that we\u2019ll disagree.\u201d\nAs you know better than 99% of the people who enjoy your blog, getting the message out there about not only Tiny Homes but the philosophy behind them is an uphill battle. When the American Dream has been the Picket Fenced 3-bedroom home and ones ability to buy as many things as you can stuff inside of it, Tiny Homes and their Philosophy are flying in the face of a long standing tradition and dream.\n\u201cSay What?!\u201d, say the uninitiated. \u201cYou want me to pare down what I own into what I just NEED!?\u201d Early examples of the Tiny Homes that you showcased had the bare minimum: a folding chair and folding table; a cup, bowl, and spoon; no water except for a container on the counter; crapping in a bucket, and the infamous LOFT BED, that so many older followers just can\u2019t navigate.\nBut, as your website developed, you also began showcasing Tiny and Small homes that were a Mid-Ground of Compromise: furniture that didn\u2019t fold up; a full kitchen; flush toilets and a main floor bed. THESE examples excite a great many people as a viable alternative to a 1000-2500 sq.ft. home.\nWhen the uninitiated even begin to see or think \u201cTiny\u201d can you even imagine if they ran across this Dumpster \u2122 example or worse yet, if a news service picked this article up and ran with it as a story about \u201cliving smaller\u201d? I understand that this is an experiment but as others have asked, \u201cAn experiment for WHAT?\u201d To push the boundaries on just WHERE humans can sleep? To find out that information, all you need do is travel to any large city with a homeless population and you\u2019ll find ALL the examples that you need to see Where & How Humans Sleep.\nIn my journey of obtaining 4 degrees, I\u2019ve taken many fun, exciting and challenging courses in my Uni days. (1 B.S.; 1 B.A; 2 M.S. degrees). I had plenty of \u201cquirky\u201d professors but they were so, unintentionally. I was willing to give this Nutty Professor the benefit of the doubt until I watched the gif. of him tumbling out of the Dumpster \u2122 on Day #1. THAT\u2019S when I lost it and felt strongly that he\u2019s an attention-hungry individual. For Crissake, he\u2019s a DEAN and Professor of Something related to design, and the Dude can\u2019t figure out that he needs a ladder to exit the Dumpster \u2122 which is strategically placed askew on the concrete pad for maximum drop?!?!\nI fully expected that my opinion of how he\u2019s trying to buck the established way of thinking of Home would be unpopular. But, I feel that for all his grandstanding and publicity over this silly project, had he taken a more useful approach to solving housing issues, he\u2019d win over a far larger audience of converts to Tiny Living, not Tiny Dumpster \u2122 Living.\nI do appreciate your opinion in the matter, Alex. \ud83d\ude00\nREPLY LINK\nJeff\nSeptember 17, 2014, 11:11 pm\nI think that there is much that you don\u2019t understand about human life. One billion people on this planet are squatters and would take something strong and solid like this dumpster in a heartbeat. One Italian proverb summarizes the fact that you can\u2019t get out of your own head: A well-fed man does not believe in hunger.\nLINK\nGetTheJobDoneRight\nOctober 5, 2014, 10:28 am\nYou\u2019re new here, right?\nREPLY LINK\nBrian\nSeptember 16, 2014, 4:11 pm\nWhat a fantastic project with some superb ideas.

Cheers!\nREPLY LINK\nSusan Stodola\nSeptember 16, 2014, 4:58 pm\nI had to laugh at the air conditioner\u2026..which I could see would be needed in a place like Austin, TX. Over all, I think the idea is genius!! and though pretty small, it would be a place a homeless person could call their own, stay out of the elements and be safe. Many don\u2019t want any more responsibility than that so why give it to them? I\u2019ve seen the shows where well meaning organizations have fixed up an apartment or home and gave it to a homeless person and within a short amount of time, it\u2019s trashed, neglected\u2026..because they don\u2019t want the responsibility!!! Listen to what they want and then make them WORK FOR it. Then they will take care of it!

Of course he\u2019s quirky, how could he not be to do this. I had plenty of professors who were brilliant but had their own \u2018style\u2019. It\u2019s kind of expected.\nWhat impressed me was the involvement of so many students & townspeople.\nThis is an experiment for 1 year. He doesn\u2019t plan to live there any longer than that as he has a perfectly beautiful home.\nCollege is a learning ground & he is teaching in an unconventional way. Who knows what ideas may come about as a result of this.\nAt any rate. He seems to be enjoying it.\nAnd he probably has much more to think about than whether he\u2019ll get laid in that. Geez\nREPLY LINK\nCahow\nSeptember 16, 2014, 10:45 pm\nYes, he DOES have a perfectly beautiful home that can\u2019t even qualify as one of Alex\u2019s largest Tiny Homes. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll enjoy the hot running water, air conditioning, flush toilet and all the other environment destroying devices in it that some people rage against.\nEven the very twin ferns at his front door bespeak wastefulness; just imagine how much precious water they suck up when he could be growing some actual FOOD PLANTS on his front porch! And then donating the extra food to a homeless shelter! Tsk-Tsk. <that paragraph was said with snark, by the way. I like ferns. \ud83d\ude09\nOh, and in a year's time, if he HASN'T thought about getting laid, then that's another topic for discussion!

I\u2019m not quirky or have that kind of style but I\u2019m definitely not against it and it doesn\u2019t even bother me one bit.

I love tiny houses and the ideas that spring from them but this idea seems more like an attention getting spoof. I just don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m also concerned about the stability of stacked dumpsters. I hope they are stable. Not judging just a little dumbfounded.\nREPLY LINK\nAlex\nSeptember 17, 2014, 9:10 am\nI understand you\u2019re thinking. I think he\u2019s just having fun, getting others to have fun and think differently, and cure the boredom of everyday normal life. That\u2019s what I think. But either way, I just like what he\u2019s doing and wanted to share it. It\u2019s extreme, yes. And probably not too great of a solution for most. But maybe it is to some??

Thanks!\nREPLY LINK\nAlex\nSeptember 17, 2014, 8:51 am\nHi Andrew- good question. I believe it\u2019s called the Hippo Water Roller. Here\u2019s the link: http://www.hipporoller.org/ But there are others too. Like the WaterWheel: http://wellowater.org/the-waterwheel/ And the Q Drum: http://www.qdrum.co.za/\nREPLY LINK\nalice h\nSeptember 17, 2014, 11:57 am\nInteresting water rolling containers but they all seem to be missing something durable to roll on besides the actual plastic container itself. Much more sensible to have a rubber tire like coating that can take the abuse. There is also a lot more resistance trying to roll a big lump of a thing than a well constructed cart with sturdy wheels. If you use 5 gallon water jugs in a cart they\u2019re a lot more easily handled and can be cleaned and filled in more places. Do a search on folding dock carts. They also have the advantage of being useful for more than one purpose.\nI\u2019ve gone from using 5 gallon jugs to the 2 1/2 gallon ones because they\u2019re easier to lift and can be filled at a kitchen sink if need be. 2 or 3 can be stacked on a folding luggage rack but be wary of the kind where the wheels stick out way behind, they tend to get hung up on stairs and whatnot.\nREPLY LINK\nMike\nSeptember 18, 2014, 4:45 pm\nMy first reaction was that a garbage can is not that creative of an idea. Like a few have mention, plenty of people have been doing it for a very long time. But aside from the goofy professor and animated videos I think this idea has some merit that isn\u2019t being discussed enough.\nFirst steel is waterproof, or can be made to be so . It\u2019s durable and can be made without using a framework . It can be secured pretty well and offer a relatively safe place for people.\nSteel has no off-gassing so there\u2019s nothing there or under there to be concerned with, except the paint. It can be cleaned fairly easily and doesnt absorb odors. These units can be stacked or built side by side so that a family can more easily occupy one, or as apartments where scaffolding could be used to reach the upper levels. Stacking is not ideal for people, but is possible.\nSteel is a terrible insulator but it could be insulated on the exterior with styrofoam board or layers of cardboard, or on the interior with carpet foam or just plain blankets. Keeping it warm would probably easier than keeping it cool. Perhaps some interchangeable panels could be used on the exterior for sunlight absorption or reflection/insulation.\nThe one thing I would definitely change is to make the entrance bigger for easier access.\nThe attraction of the dumpster design is it\u2019s simplicity. I\u2019ve been studying tiny homes for over a year and find that building them takes a lot of effort, time, and money. Steel containers are straight-forward and a lot simpler to construct -saving labor. But if the two could be merged, there might be a way to mass produce something that is durable and completely recyclable.\nREPLY LINK\nDenise\nSeptember 20, 2014, 12:00 am\nThis guy is blissfully nuts. I just hope the local garbage truck doesn\u2019t come by, pick up his new home and dump all it\u2019s contents, including him into the back chute. Otherwise we will be reading about him in the paper or on the national news and it won\u2019t be because he made a tiny house out of a dumpster. \ud83d\ude42\nREPLY LINK\nAlex\nSeptember 20, 2014, 10:40 am\nBlissfully nuts, lol, love that\nREPLY LINK\nMichael J. Beninate\nSeptember 21, 2014, 5:32 pm\nToo many of you are missing the point about the dumpster house. It is a stunt. It is an experiment. It is designed to get attention and is being promoted to get attention.\nAs an experiment it can fail. They want to find out if a person can live a happy life within this small dumpster space. What has been learned already is that the answer is no. Look at the additions and the planned expansion of it. That is an indication that thirty-three square feet isn\u2019t enough for what they want to have in the small living quarters.\nThirty-three square feet is plenty of space for just sleeping and having a closet. It isn\u2019t big enough for a shower, toilet, kitchen, and the other things homes have. What this experiment will eventually do is develop an idea of how much square footage is actually needed for a single person to live comfortably.\nAnybody who has spent time on this site will see that the original Tumbleweed homes made living easy in as little as eighty-four square feet with a loft that added more square feet. The Tumbleweed XS was sixty-five square feet plus a loft. They don\u2019t advertise that model anymore but they will sell the plans for it.\nThe back of a full size old style American van is between ten feet and twelve feet long. The back of a minivan is eight feet long behind the front seats. They are about five feet wide. That equals forty square feet of floor space. The big difference is that standing in a van isn\u2019t possible without a very high roof added.\nLiving in a minivan would seem like a better choice than a dumpster size box even though it is possible to stand in the dumpster.\nREPLY LINK\nChelsea\nNovember 27, 2017, 5:28 pm\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQTVuRrZO8w\nAfter watching above YouTube video \u2013 kudos to the professor for this gigantic micro idea. This tiny idea may actually have sparked something bigger that we thought was not possible at all.

He also has a light bulb, one of the first improvements he made to the dumpster.\nIn the fall, he plans to add insulation, which presents an engineering problem: how to fit four inches of insulation into a 33-square-foot dumpster without losing too much wall space.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\nThe dumpster has no shower or toilet. Wilson said he may convert a wall into an extendable washroom section which could be retracted when not in use.\nFor now, he uses the university\u2019s washrooms.\nThe dumpster has cellphone service, even when the top is closed, and will also soon have an Internet connection.\nWilson keeps just a handful of personal belongings and a few pairs of pants, shirts and shoes.\nOver the last week, he also radically reduced his bow tie wardrobe, cutting it in half after reading an article in The Atlantic in which he was quoted talking about his \u201ceight or nine\u201d bow ties.\n\u201cI realized that was kind of an excess,\u201d Wilson said.\nHe has also been discarding items with only sentimental value, starting with old photos \u2014 he now has digital copies \u2014 and trinkets like a piece of jade jewelry he gave a friend with the caveat he may ask for it back.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\nGetting rid of those objects was the \u201chardest thing,\u201d he said, adding that decluttering his physical space has simplified his life. \u201cI\u2019m a lot happier in my current state than I was in my previous state, with all the stuff and all the space,\u201d he said.\nWhen Wilson is out of town or not sleeping in the dumpster, his students often stay over. Many have re-evaluated how much space and stuff they actually need, he said.\n\u201cWe want our students having these conversations in their heads, and we want to spark a conversation on campus and in society,\u201d he said.\nWilson isn\u2019t suggesting everyone live in such a tiny space but hopes to show it\u2019s possible to have a \u201cpretty good life\u201d with very little.\n\u201cI like to call the dumpster a conversation box,\u201d he said.\nIn Toronto, two detached homes cannot be situated on the same lot, and past projects to build laneway housing have needed special zoning amendments.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\nOther cities, like Vancouver, have embraced laneway housing as a way to provide additional housing at a reduced cost and with a smaller environmental footprint.\nBobbi Kyle, a designer and master\u2019s student in Vancouver, lives in a 250-square-foot converted garage behind a home in the city\u2019s West Side.\nIt\u2019s seven times larger than Wilson\u2019s dumpster, but about an eighth of the size of the average 1,900-square-foot Canadian home.\nThe home is the most affordable Kyle has rented, and she likes the simplicity of small living. \u201cI just have what I need, and that\u2019s it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn many ways we attach our past to objects and artifacts of living. The less of these that you keep the less you inadvertently dwell on the past,\u201d Kyle explained.\nBeing forced to buy food and supplies regularly but in small amounts \u2014 she can\u2019t store much inside \u2014 has cut her household waste production, she said.\nKyle said she also finds herself exploring her neighbourhood more.\nBut the small space has forced changes to her relationships and lifestyle.\n\u201cI\u2019m less social in some ways. There\u2019s a risk of isolating oneself in a space like this,\u201d Kyle said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your space, but you either have to go out or be in. You can\u2019t entertain, because it\u2019s too small. You\u2019re either an introvert or an extrovert \u2014 there\u2019s no medium.\u201d\nA busy student, Kyle said she enjoys the solitude but wouldn\u2019t recommend it for everyone.\n\u201cIt requires a certain amount of discipline, or someone who is really Spartan in their way of living,\u201d she said.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\nAs an undergraduate student at Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver, she worked on a project to design a 90-square-foot apartment.\nLiving in a space that small might be practical for a short time but requires drastic lifestyle changes, she said.\nFor Kyle, about 200 square feet seems to be the minimum amount of space needed to feel comfortable, she said.\nShe has no plans to scale up her housing. For now, neither does Wilson.\n\u201cI may wake up one morning and say, \u2018What the hell am I doing? I want all of my stuff back and I want to live in a 2,000-square-foot place,\u2019 \u201d the professor said.\nAfter the dumpster project, Wilson said he\u2019s considering trying to build the smallest legal home in Austin. The city\u2019s building code is more suited to large dwellings, and building a tiny home would require some legal manoeuvring, he said.\n\u201cMy girlfriend is betting that I\u2019m not going to move into any kind of normal living arrangement after this is done,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s probably right.\u201d\nRiley Sparks\nRiley Sparks is a former Toronto Star staff reporter.\nREPORT AN ERROR\nJOURNALISTIC STANDARDS\nABOUT THE STAR\nYou Might Be Interested In\nENTERTAINMENT\n'The Lion King,' 'Mamma Mia!' \u2014 the \u201990s are back onstage.

Wilson is documenting his progress on the website dumpsterproject.org, using videos and social media to showcase his sustainable living project.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just to explore the idea of less,\u201d he told ABC station KTRK in Houston.\nStudents, who helped clean the Dumpster before Wilson moved in, were stunned when he announced his plan.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at all,\u201d student Charles Deshaw said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re really going to live in a Dumpster?\u2019\u201d\nThe front door slides shut. It\u2019s cold at night. The walls contain decorative hangings. The home features few appliances such as a washer and dryer, which were added during the current phase of his project. The third and final phase will feature solar panels with a focus on renewable energy.\nFor Wilson \u2014 who goes by the nickname \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d \u2014 the second night in the Dumpster was scariest.\n\u201cThe trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors,\u201d Wilson told KTRK.\nLuckily, Wilson\u2019s new home remained untouched by trash crews. After living in the Dumpster for six months, Wilson is proud of the discourse his experiment has encouraged and that it has promoted the idea of living with less.\nIt\u2019s important to \u201cfoster a conversation and keep that conversation going.

It was scant living at first, with water being lugged up all the way from the local lake every few days. But things progressed quickly, and just yesterday, Prof Wilson gave the shell\u2019s interior a lick of paint, and picked a \u201cfull selection of ripe and sweet baby tomatoes, collard greens, okra and various herbs\u201d from the so-called Dumpster Garden.\nPhase two and three of the design will see a shower, toilet, multiple stories, and appliances like a washing machine, dryer, and a hot water heater introduced, all of which will use 1 per cent of the energy an average American home uses.\nMore: See the latest floor plans here\nRead More\nRead next\nSPONSORED\nMalaysia steps up pro-Palestinian stance, straining ties with U.S.\nNIKKEI ASIA\nSPONSORED\nUS Citizen Abroad?

Her bae, environmental science professor Jeff Wilson, has taken upon himself the name Professor Dumpster and spent the last year living in a dumpster that he and his students have slowly been converting into a slightly more livable dumpster. This week, in Salon, she answers the most pressing question underpinning this innovative experiment in adaptive reuse and pared-down living: what's it like to \"fool around\" in there?\nWhat it's like to \"fool around\" in there is \"more complicated than it used to be\":\n\"When it comes to privacy, our choices are often limited to the occasional house visit and the dumpster, which is usually parked a few feet behind the women's residence hall. We regularly get asked if we've done the deed in the dumpster. For the sake of Jeff's position, all I'm at liberty to say is discreet passion is (almost) impossible in a thin metal box where one careless sigh can inform the entire neighborhood on the finer points of our recreational activity.\" Discreet passion: almost, but not quite impossible within a tricked-out garbage receptacle. Professor Jeff Dumpster also spends the rare night at her house, but he \"feels guilty\" there, \"almost like he's cheating.\" He doesn't even keep a spare tootbrush there. (What's up with THAT, Jeff??)\nBensen allows that their setup is \"one of the more peculiar ones around,\" but it stays \"vibrant and loving\u2014due, in no small part, to the fact that we're flexible and we welcome the strange and curious. We still want each other after all these wild months. We're still slow to say goodnight.\"\nPresumably, this is because of mushy gushy prolonged goodbyes, and not because Bensen has to \"channel a chimpanzee\" to enter or exit her boyfriend's house. In any case, hats off to these crazy young lovebirds.\n\u00b7 My boyfriend lives in a dumpster [Salon]\n\u00b7 'Prof. Dumpster' Will Teach Your Kids to Live in a Garbage Bin [Curbed National]\nNEXT UP IN TINY HOMES\nfrom Curbed LA Tiny 1920s Bungalow Near Dodger Stadium Asks $699K\n5 cool prefab backyard sheds you can buy right now\nGorgeous tiny house oasis built for paradise\nOff-grid circular tiny home available for preorder\n5 cool prefab backyard sheds you can buy right now\nfrom Curbed Boston South End studio asks $430,000 for its 295 square feet\nTerms of Use Privacy Notice Cookie Policy Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Info Licensing FAQ Accessibility Platform Status\nContact Send Us a Tip Community Guidelines Masthead About Curbed Newsletters Editorial Ethics and Guidelines\nVox Media Vox Media logo.\nAdvertise with us\nJobs @ Vox Media\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

What about a 33 square foot dumpster? Well, one Huston-Tillotson University professor is about to do just that. Professor Dumpster (you may know him by his given name Dr. Jeff Wilson), is a Harvard and University of Canterbury-educated environmental science professor who has decided to live in a dumpster for a whole calendar year.\nBeginning this fall, Professor Dumpster will take up residence in the customized trash bin in order to spread awareness about sustainability and promote the model of \"less is more.\" After posting on Facebook that he was selling everything he owned for a single dollar (we wish we had seen that status update), Wilson moved into his office at HT to begin the process of lessening his environmental impact and living on a smaller scale.\nBeginning this fall, Professor Dumpster will take up residence in the customized trash bin in order to spread awareness about sustainability and promote the model of \"less is more.\"\nBut this isn't just a story about living in a dumpster. Professor Dumpster is after all a teacher, and this year-long experiment is a chance for his students to design, build and test the bin with the goal of taking it from a garbage can to a home. \u201cThe idea here is to ultimately show one can have a pretty good life in a dumpster,\" Wilson told Fast Company.\nThe first phase of the project is to outfit the tiny space to have many of the creature comforts of a modern home: shower, kitchen, bed, WiFi and toilet. After that, the goal is to design the space to be as energy efficient as possible in order to reduce its environmental impact (think things like solar panels and energy producing toilets).\nFor times when the professor just needs to get out of the trash can, students can opt to stay overnight in the dumpster. As one HT student told KVUE, she's already excited to spend a night in the bin. \"I think it's pretty intriguing,\" said Evette Jackson. \"It's pretty cool. I want to live in it too.\"\nAfter his year of living in 6 feet by 6 feet is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the country to teach students about the possibility of living outside the box while living, well, inside a box.\nYou can follow Professor Dumpsters latest adventures on The Dumpster Project blog.\nLEADING THE WAY\nCultureMap founder David Gow to lead Houston policy nonprofit\nBy Natalie Harms, InnovationMapAug 7, 2024 | 5:03 pm\nDavid Gow will begin his new role in September. Photo by Daniel Ortiz\nA nonprofit organization dedicated to leading Houston into the future has named its next leader.\nThe Center for Houston\u2019s Future named David Gow as president and CEO, succeeding Brett Perlman, who was announced in April to be remaining at the Center with a focus on the Center\u2019s hydrogen initiative. Gow is the founder and chairman of Gow Media, CultureMap's parent company. His role is effective September 3.\n\u201cI am excited to step into this opportunity with the Center and work with the team, the board and many other stakeholders to help shape Houston\u2019s future,\u201d Gow said in a statement. \u201cThe Center presents an exciting opportunity to cast a vision for our region and identify initiatives that will make an impact.\u201d\nGow \u2014 whose portfolio includes CultureMap, its sister sites, and ESPN Radio's Houston affiliate \u2014 is a board member of Goose Capital and chair of MSAI, an entity he formed through a SPAC acquisition. Before he founded Gow Media, he served as CFO and CEO of online watch retailer Ashford.com. Prior to Ashford, Gow was director of corporate strategy at Compaq Computers and a consultant at McKinsey & Co. He received his master\u2019s in public policy from Harvard and his bachelor's in economics from Williams College.\n\u201cDavid\u2019s portfolio of experiences and skills, record of innovation and success, and deep commitment to the Houston community make him the perfect fit to lead the Center as we chart and execute on our next set of initiatives focused on ensuring a bright future for all residents in the Houston region,\u201d adds Center for Houston\u2019s Future Board Chair Cindy Yeilding.\nIn his new role, Gow will lead the Center\u2019s next effort, Vision 2050, which plans to identify the city's key issues, gaps, and opportunities.\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement also reflects the success of the Center\u2019s clean hydrogen program,\u201d Yeilding continues. \u201cOn behalf of the Center\u2019s board, I\u2019d also like to recognize Brett for launching and building such a successful and important effort as well as his overall leadership and record of achievement at the Center these past seven years.\u201d\n----\nThis article first appeared on our sister site InnovationMap.\nCULTUREMAP EMAILS ARE AWESOME\nGet Austin intel delivered daily.\npromoted series\nVisit El Paso\nExplore art, history, nature + more at these 10 awesome El Paso museums\nSoak up the sun with a breezy getaway to historic and outdoorsy El Paso",

Wilson officially moved out on Feb. 4 after successfully completing his sustainable and minimalist experiment. But that\u2019s not the end for \u201cProfessor Dumpster.\u201d Here, in a follow-up interview, he talks about his experiences living in the dumpster, his new eyebrow-raising project and more.\nWhat are the top three things you took away from the experience of living in a dumpster?\nOne would be the joy that spending more time engaging with the community around you brings into your life. When you live in such a small space, it\u2019s not super comfortable all the time, so I just spent more time around campus\u2014I spent more time walking around the community interacting with folks, not cooped up in my home. The second was all of the benefits of living in a smaller space. I can name them for hours, but things like lower rent, living in the area you would like to live in, lower utilities, less time spent cleaning the house, all of those things you just take as givens. When you really compress the stuff that you have and the space that you have, you\u2019re able to cut out a lot of the noise. It\u2019s also just kind of keeping life interesting, keeping you on your toes. With a radical personal experiment like this you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and it\u2019s pretty rare these days that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. We get a few curveballs along the way, but for a middle-aged man like myself, most stuff is generally mapped out. It\u2019s nice to have some magic. It\u2019s nice to have some surprises.\nDid you feel sad or relieved when you moved out?\nI cried like a baby. I seriously did, I have it on video. They were real tears. It really was my home.\nYou said the highest temp in the dumpster was 130 degrees and the lowest was 23 degrees. How did you deal with the elements?\nI got used to the conditions; you just don\u2019t spend as much time in there in the middle of the day. Sleeping through there in the night is easier to do in the cold if you have the right technology; I was always able to have a warm sleeping bag. Right before I got the A/C in August I had this sad little fan from Wal-Mart that ran on double A batteries. I would put next to my face and sleep under a mosquito net, so it was pretty miserable.\nNow that you\u2019ve moved out, what\u2019s going to happen to the dumpster?\nI want to be very clear that it\u2019s not actually the end of the project. I\u2019m no longer living in the dumpster, but it\u2019s now a place for educators to come to inspire their students. They come and spend the night, or sometimes more than one night, in the dumpster, and we give them curriculum and things to take back to the classroom. We\u2019ve already had an elementary school principal, a capstone teacher from a high school and a superintendent from Dallas signed up. We\u2019re also going to be opening up an artists residency program there. We have artists stay there and work on some piece of art that has to do with sustainability, and we\u2019ll also raise money for them to stay a night in the dumpster.\nWhen does your new project, 99 Nights ATX start?\nThat starts right after SXSW. We\u2019ve already had 60 nominations, and we\u2019re trying to get to 300 by the end of South By, then develop a shortlist and start staying in homes. We\u2019re working on a few iconic type homes, but we\u2019re also in real need of regular homes. We\u2019re trying to describe what makes a house a home in Austin and all the homes in Austin aren\u2019t weird. In fact, most of them aren\u2019t, so we need more nominations for a three-bedroom, two-bath in South Austin of someone who has been living there five years. We need more submissions from places like Dove Springs and Pflugerville. Some of the submissions we\u2019ve had include an assisted living home, a few from the Austonian, the Mueller development, Westlake mansions and a homeless camp community. That\u2019s going to be a real interesting experiment, especially with types of housing that I don\u2019t think have got the attention they deserve.\nYou\u2019ve also been in the press due to your romantic, minimalistic travel OkCupid date that went viral when your now-girlfriend Clara Bensen wrote about it on Salon.com. Now she has a book about the experience coming out this fall and a movie deal. What do you think about that?\nI think it\u2019s great! I think that was just another sort of small radical personal experiment, this one happened to end up yielding a girlfriend that would stay with me through the whole year of living in a dumpster. I think it\u2019s going to be a much more introspective book, not just a rom-com about traveling around Europe. It has a lot about the existential experience of the millennial.\nWho would you pick to play you in the movie?\nIs Robert Downey Jr. too old? Yeah, maybe him. I know that Shailene Woodley has expressed interest [in the movie], too.\nSo, are you still going to call yourself Professor Dumpster?\nWell, I may have to come up with a symbol and call myself the Artist Formerly Known As Professor Dumpster. But then, of course, Prince went back to Prince. \nPopular Articles\nWhy Is Austin Dating So Cursed?\nA Major Developer\u2019s Collapse Leaves Abandoned Projects Scattered Across Austin\nThe 25 Best Tacos in Austin\n50 Great Dates in Austin\n6 Texas Beaches Just a Short Drive From Austin\nWhat\u2019s With All These Breakups in Austin?\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nCurrent Issue\nArchives\nTRENDING NOW\n1907\u2019s Chill Summer, and Other Austin Weather Records That Might Surprise You\nThe Highland Lakes Are Rising Again!

Perhaps you recycle or ride a bicycle to work instead of taking the car to do your bit but would you consider moving into a dumpster for a year? That is just what Dr Jeff Wilson from the Huston-Tillotson University decided to do; take an old dumpster, transform it and then live in it for a whole year.\n[Image Source: Dumpster Project]\nProject Dumpster aims to investigate sustainable living practices as the population is forever increasing while space and resources are decreasing. The dumpster chosen for the project is 33 square feet and Dr Wilson says that it should make people consider what can be done with less space. He hopes that the project will encourage people to talk about it along with bringing out other ideas on the topic.\nCGI art and firetex, the best of IE this week\n[Image Source: Dumpster Project]\nOf course as he is going to live in it for a year, he had to make sure that there would be enough living space and so, many modifications were made to it. The dumpster has been prepared firstly by being cleaned out thoroughly and then rust proofed. In order for it to offer some degree of warmth it needed insulation and then thought was given to hanging a clothes line for drying clothes along with making a rain garden.\n[Image Source: Dumpster Project]\nOf course there was the essential installation of a toilet and a false floor was added into the box for storage. Solar panels provide sustainable electrical energy which of course doesn\u2019t come with the monthly bill. The \u201csmall home\u201d was also given a weather station, air conditioning, pitched roof, its own mailbox and locks. The pockets of the dumpster were sealed to ensure that it could not be mistaken for a trash receptacle that was in use.\nRECOMMENDED ARTICLES\nMalaysia steps up pro-Palestinian stance, straining ties with U.S.\nNikkei Asia\nUS Citizens abroad can still vote in 2024.

The reason for his unusual nickname? He has decided to live in a dumpster for the next year - Yes, the kind that you might find filled with trash behind a restaurant or in an alley.\nWilson says the inspiration to do something this radical first hit him two years ago, when he was working on an article at a neighborhood coffee shop and caught sight of an eight-yard dumpster. So when his apartment lease ran out a year later, the professor sold all of his possessions and spent the next seven months sleeping in his office, while he searched for a suitable trash can.\nNow that he has found one, Professor Dumpster is putting his students to work. After all, the point of this project isn't just to spend his life living out of a garbage can: there is, a much greater purpose involved. As an environmental scientist, the professor constantly ponders about sustainable living and how every person should try minimize his/her impact on our already stretched resources. That, is the challenge Wilson wanted his students to step up to, this entire year.\nUsing their math, science, engineering, and technology skills he wants them to retrofit his 33 square-foot dumpster into a modern space that includes a shower, toilet, kitchen and bed and is fitted with amenities like air-conditioning and even WiFi. The one caveat? It all has to be 'green' and sustainable.\nSome important things Wilson's students will have to consider are how to retrieve water, harness energy and keep a healthy living space. To live in this dumpster comfortably, the Professor will need filtered water for drinking, cooking, as well as, for other everyday activities like the toilet and shower. While this is not that big a deal, given that the dumpster has to be sustainable means that the used water has to be recycled as efficiently as possible. In order to ensure that the professor remains healthy there also needs to be adequate ventilation, as well as, cooling and heating systems that function efficiently, without utilizing too much energy or space.\nWhile this may sound like an impossible task, the students are stepping up to the challenge and seem to be figuring it all out. By incorporating solar panels for lighting and electricity, nano-insulation to regulate temperature, and \"energy-producing\" toilets, they plan to create a \"net zero\" model. That means that the dumpster-home will only consume as much energy as it produces. Innovative systems are also being developed for water filtration, climate control, and waste reduction, resulting in what will eventually be a comfortable living space where nothing is wasted. Meanwhile, the professor has already moved into his bare-bones home where he spends the nights 'hanging out' inside a sleeping bag on the floor - quite literally, given that he is 6'1\".\nWhen completed, Wilson's new home will boast some pretty impressive statistics - At 33 square feet the compact home will use zero electricity, just 4 gallons of water per day and apparently produce close to zero trash. In contrast, an average 2,480 square-feet American home uses about 9,500 Kilowatts of energy per month and spends 400 gallons of water and generates 4.5 pounds of trash per day!\nSo why is Wilson planning to go through such hardship? Because he wants to equip his students with the tools to survive in a world that is rapidly heading towards a population of 10 billion people. A world in which resources and space are going to be so restrained that a large majority of the population may have to adjust to living in tighter spaces.\nBy promoting awareness and education on these subjects, Wilson is helping students everywhere see that living \"small\" and sustainably is certainly possible. And while the dumpster project may seem a little melodramatic to some, the professor thinks of it as a \u201cplayful and imaginative\u201d educational experiment and conversation-starter to discuss the fact that all of us can do with less as we move into the future.\nThe scientist is of course is not planning to spend his entire life in this dumpster - Just over a year during which time he will tour the country, visiting schools and teaching kids about sustainable living. Given that the professor is planning to do that stealthily, be sure to keep an eye out and investigate if a relatively clean-looking dumpster suddenly shows up on your playground - Professor Dumpster might just be lurking inside!\nWilson is not the first person to have come up with this idea. California designer Gregory Kloehn has already refurbished a dumpster into a luxury home and now regards it his 'home away from home' for whenever he visits New York. While his may not be as sustainable as the one that the professor is planning to create, judging from the video below, it sure is cool.\nResources: dumpsterproject.org,mnn.com,grist.org,fastcoexist.com,curbed.com\nCite Article\nMLA\nChicago\nAPA\nLearn Keywords in this Article\nPlay Game\n548\nComments (548)\nPost comment\nC and C\n11 years ago\nWho would live In a dumpster?\nReply\n0 Likes\nlioness12\n11 years ago\ni wonder if he has air freshener?\nReply\n0 Likes\nlioness12\n11 years ago\ni ve heard of dumpster diving,but dumpster living???????? cool but bit exetreme.\nReply\n0 Likes\nhi\n11 years ago\nI agree we should ALL live in a dumpster\nReply\n0 Likes\nFreehawk324\n11 years ago\nIt's actually ironic how easy it would be to live in a large dumpster if you have the right supplies!\nReply\n0 Likes\nFreehawk324\n11 years ago\nThat's my dream home\nReply\n0 Likes\njojo\n11 years ago\nwe should all live in dumpster\nReply\n0 Likes\njojo\n11 years ago\nsweet\nReply\n0 Likes\nseagull soars\n11 years ago\nthis is really cool\nReply\n0 Likes\nman huoter\n11 years ago\nthat is crazy cool\nReply\n0 Likes\nShow More\nPopular Articles\nWeek\nMonth\nYear\nRare Orange Lobster Rescued By Restaurant Employee\nElephants Assign Unique \"Names\" To Each Other, Just Like Humans\nCenturies Old Preserved Fruit Unearthed At George Washington's Home\nRoman Beach Buried By Mount Vesuvius's Eruption Now Open\nScream For Ice Cream !

When you hear this, your mind might automatically visualise a homeless man, or so I assume. But this is not the case, Jeff chose to live in a dumpster to escape his conventional, consumerist and comfortable lifestyle.\nAccording to the Washington Post, before his dumpster days, he was living in a comfortable, 3,000 square-foot home in Texas, with a walk-in closet, a grand and accessible bathroom and a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. He worked as a professor at a state university, he commuted one hour to work everyday and had \"a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\"\nAnd now, he has none of those things and has never been happier! So what changed?\nHe received a new job as an associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson Univsersity in Austin, and lived in a dumpster on the college campus for a year until he vacated last month.\n\u201cAS A WAY OF HAVING A BETTER LIFE, I DECIDED TO MOVE INTO A DUMPSTER.\u201d\n- JEFF WILSON TOLD THE POST\nHe decks out the dumpster pretty well, complete with air-conditioning, a mailbox and false-floor storage space. The challenge was done to prove that people don't need a big home packed with endless possessions to be happy, and they exist!\nThe immediate benefits were obvious to Wilson, they included lower rent, lower utility payments, less time spent doing chores, shorter commute (90 seconds on foot) and less money spent on unnecessary possessions.\nBecause of his much smaller living space, Wilson told the post that he spent a lot less time at home. Instead, he hung around on campus ACTUALLY speaking to people and interacting with other human beings.\nAccording to the Washington Post, \"There are all these studies that say the broader and deeper your social network is, not only does it create more happiness, but it increases your life span,\" Wilson said. \"In the modern home you can have a cradle to grave experience. Your doula can pop you out in the living room, you can get an MIT education online, order food from outside and then work from home until you die in the living room watching your flat screen TV.\"\nWilson had to give up almost all of his possessions. Among the few possessions he purchased while living in the dumpster were a garden gnome and a small air conditioning unit, as the dumpster reached scorching hot levels inside.\nFrom his dumpster experiment Wilson also learnt the detriment of noise, and how it keeps us from looking for a meaningful life.\n\"You can't be aware enough to watch for meaning if you're buried in e-mails or facing a barrage of direct messages on Twitter,\" he told The Post. \"You don't have the bandwidth or the time or the attention to watch. You're looking, but watching is a different exercise.\"\nThe dumpster project allows all of us to really think about the stuff we own and what we rely on, or what we THINK we need. If we take a leaf from Professor Dumpster's book then we can see just how little we need to be happy, and that human interaction and experiences are what create purpose... not things.\nImages credited to Sarah Natsumi More and Jeff Wilson\nDid you like this post?\nThen join us in taking practical climate action to live better for us and for the planet.\nJoin 1 Million Women\nCARBON\nCHALLENGE\n704,728,747,935\nTONNES OF CO2\nSAVINGS PLEDGED\nCan you cut 1 Tonne of carbon pollution out of your life?\nTake the challenge\nSUBSCRIBE TO\nOUR NEWSLETTER\nTo get a notification when new blog articles come out\nSubscribe\nSHEA HOGARTH\nFORMER INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT\nSUGGEST AN ARTICLE SEND US AN EMAIL\nPOPULAR BLOG ARTICLES\nWeaving a home...how one woman can help millions of people globally\n19th Aug 2015\n8 Single-Use Items to Ditch From Your Life\n18th Feb 2015\nThis alien-like creature will break your heart when you find out what it really is...\n18th Mar 2015\nCONTACT US\nPRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS OF USE\n\u00a9 COPYRIGHT 1 MILLION WOMEN\n  1\nJoin 1 Million Women!\nSign Up!\nJoin 1 Million Women\nYou're joining women and girls from across the globe taking action on climate change.\nNo thanks",

He admits managing the toilet smells can be an issue\n+\n9\nView gallery\nMaintaining a comfortable temperature was initially a problem until Mr Wilson built temperature controls\nDesigns may include solar power generation, a composting toilet, a flat screen television, and a passive-solar heated shower \n'I'm not as concerned about the shower,' he told The Atlantic, 'but getting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run.'\nCurrently, he uses facilities at the university's gym, but a toilet and shower will soon connect to the dumpster externally. \n'You don't really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,' he explained. \nAfter the year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the United States, educating students about the possibility of following in his 'less is more' footsteps.\nWilson said the project idea came to him two years ago while he was sipping a latte at Starbucks.\n'I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster,' he told Fast Company.\nSo when the lease ran out on his lovely, full-sized, apartment a year later, he posted an announcement on Facebook, which read: 'Starting at 6pm, I will be selling all of my home furnishings, clothes, kitchen appliances, and everything else in the apartment for $1 an item.' \nDespite, the five-item-per-person maximum, his home was empty by nightfall except for a modest suitcase, which was coming with him to the dumpster.\nHowever, the dumpster wasn't ready at that stage, so he moved into his office for the next seven months, secretly sleeping on the floor until he moved in, in Feburary. \n'Keeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3 a.m. cleaning staff and 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,' he told the website.  \nHe said: 'We hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing, energy sustainability, science education, and higher quality of life.\n'Ultimately, the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing.\n'This is an outlier experiment. The students and university, thought they thought the experiment a bit odd, have warmed to the idea, even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to.'\n   Share or comment on this article: Texas professor Jeff Wilson adjusts to life in a dumpster\n14\nshares\nRecommended by\nThai baht hits 13-month high against dollar on economic hopes\nNikkei Asia | Sponsored\nAmericans abroad can request their ballot via email!\nCenter for U.S. Voters Abroad Turnout Project | Sponsored\nDoctors Baffled: Foot Neuropathy Device Takes Singapore by Storm\nLimited Consumer Deals | Sponsored\nSingapore\u2019s veteran diplomat Kishore Mahbubani, a China optimist\nThinkChina | Sponsored\nSingapore: New Small Electric Car For Seniors - The Price May Surprise You\nElectric Cars | Search Ads | Sponsored\nEverything in the range is not just incredibly affordable with prices starting at just $11!\nMail Online\nYou need to get your hands on a bottle of Bird&Be Gentle Prenatal Gummies to stay healthy throughout your pregnancy without causing queasiness!\nMail Online\nYoung woman in tears over huge male problem in Australia\nNews\nIf you own a mouse, you have to play this game.

It's in a metal dumpster that is typically meant for trash. His experiment is attracting a lot of attention.\n\nJeff Wilson, an environmental science professor at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is known as 'Professor Dumpster' for teaching his students how to live while making a minimal impact on the environment.\n\n\"We want to teach issues around sustainability, STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] education, living on less, to a much broader audience than you might just reach in one small environmental science class,\" said Wilson.\n\nThe course is divided into three phases, the first one being basic camping. Every day, either Wilson, one of his students or a member of the community spends a day in the dumpster.\n\n\"They use sleeping bags, filter the water from a nearby lake and wash with wet towels. For a toilet, they use bottles or the college restrooms. They also grow vegetables in a small garden,\" he said.\n\nIn the second phase they will use energy-efficient appliances, while in the last phase their \u201chome\u201d will get solar panels and a composting toilet.\n\nIn the beginning, some students were skeptical. Others say they liked the idea from the start.\n\n\u201cHe explained about the dumpster project and I told him, 'that's so weird that it's awesome.\u2019 So I got right on board,\u201d said student Angelica Erazo.\n\nWilson said three square meters is slightly more than one percent of the average new American home. He wants to see if it\u2019s possible to live with only one percent of average energy and water consumption, while creating only one percent of the average home\u2019s waste.\n\nThe experiment will last for a year, during which the residents of the tiny home will carefully track energy and water usage, as well as the amount of generated waste.\nRelated\nEagerly-awaited Technology Turns Garbage into Fuel\nAfrica Developing Unified Climate Strategy\nMore Science & Health News\nWhat is Telegram, why was its CEO arrested in Paris?\nFrance's Macron: Arrest of head of Telegram messaging app wasn't political\nChina robot conference spotlights the changing face of humanoids\nPavel Durov has nothing to hide, Telegram says of arrested founder\nChinese entities turn to Amazon cloud, rivals to access US chips, AI\nThe Day in Photos\nAugust 26, 2024\nFOLLOW US\nUNITED STATES\nUS News\nImmigration\nAll About America\nSilicon Valley & Technology\nWORLD\nAfrica\nThe Americas\nEast Asia Pacific\nEurope\nMiddle East\nSouth & Central Asia\nSECTIONS\nVOA Programs\nSpecial projects\nDay in Photos\nPress Freedom\nRefugees\nVOA News on Iran\nVOA News on China\nArts & Culture\nEconomy & Business\nHealth\nExtremism Watch\nStudent Union\n52 Documentary\nVideos\nMORE FROM VOA\nVOAAfrica.com Programs\nVOA Learning English\nPolygraph.info\nEditorials\nABOUT THIS SITE\nTerms of Use & Privacy Notice\nAbout VOA\nGet VOA+\nVOA Around the World\nContact VOA\nMedia Relations\nUsage Requests\nVOA Pronunciation Guide\nMD",

Jeffrey Wilson, affectionately known as Professor Dumpster, moved into a dumpster on Huston-Tillotson University campus back in March to prove to his students and the community that you can have a good life while using only 1% of the water and energy used by the average American household. (His dumpster is also 1% the size of the average home at six by six feet.)\nAt first, Wilson was essentially camping in this dumpster, getting water from the town lake, using candlelight, and storing his very few belongings in a false plywood floor. In August, he entered Phase II of the project. They were able to equip the dumpster with air conditioning just in time for Texas heat of August. In this phase, the dumpster will be hooked up to the electrical grid and afforded many amenities of the modern home such as bedding, cooking supplies, solar lighting, and an improved roof.\nPhase III, called The \u00dcber Dumpster, will kick off in Spring 2015. In this phase, the team plans to combine the best of the first two phases \u2014 using modern amenities while creating the smallest ecological footprint possible. Design ideas for Phase III include a composting toilet, solar-heated shower, and a flat screen television.\nTo keep up to date with Professor Dumpster and the HT Green is the New BlackTM student organization, check out the website.\nPosted in Industry News\nHear What Our Satisfied Customers Have to Say\n\u2039\nCompetive pricing, careful and skilled delivery and placement and removal, and on time.\nReview of , reflecting an experience on 5/8/2024 by Scott G\nGreat service.

He has his sales pitch nailed\u2014which is pretty impressive for a former university dean and professor who used to live in a dumpster.\nWhen I ask Wilson what fundamental problem his company is solving he tells me without flinching: \u201cKasita is on the verge of disrupting the urban housing market in ways not seen in real estate and development in 150 years.\u201d Wilson\u2019s confidence may just be spot on. And perfectly timed.\nKasita Founder and CEO Jeff Wilson, a.k.a. \"Professor Dumpster\". Courtesy of Kasita\nPROMOTED\nOver the past decade my wife and I have asked each other countless times why everything else we own is completely mobile with the glaring exception of real estate. It\u2019s not an unreasonably philosophical question. Every current aspect of our personal and business lives\u2014from banking and corporate communications to reading the news or planning a vacation\u2014now runs entirely off of five mobile devices and a wireless hotspot. So why do we still sleep in a house every night with two-foot thick brick walls that hasn\u2019t moved an inch in 128 years?\nSeeing a massive, mobility-starved void in the dead center of one of the largest segments of the US economy (while living in a dumpster), Wilson is betting that his tech-stuffed, 320-square foot, portable living capsule (a.k.a. casita, or \u201csmall home\u201d) is poised to transform the fundamental concept of what real estate means to a new generation of Millennials, empty nesters, and upwardly mobile creative types (e.g., us) who are looking to trade-in their 30-year mortgage for mobility, simplicity, and financial independence.\nPassport: Explore the finest destinations and experiences around the world in the Forbes Passport newsletter.\nGet the latest news on special offers, product updates and content suggestions from Forbes and its affiliates.\nSign Up\nBy signing up, you agree to our Terms of Service, and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.

Learn how to find the perfect rental and negotiate a lease that meets your needs.\nCourtesy of Kasita\nBroadly speaking, Wilson\u2019s Kasita falls into the architectural category of prefabricated micro housing, sharing common themes with the tiny house movement like surgically efficient use of interior space and small-scale affordability. Conceptually, Kasita is what you\u2019d end up with if you crossbred a chic, modern Airstream with a container house and nested it inside of an automated parking garage.\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nIn terms of mobility specifically, Kasita is a first of its kind. Wilson\u2019s Model One prototype, which was recently unveiled at South By Southwest, is a sleek, simplistic glass-and-steel box that can get up and go when life says it\u2019s time for a change. Each Kasita slides into an engineered steel exo-skeleton that can be built in under a week on any open lot in any city up to ten stories high (for now). If you need\u2014or want\u2014to move, your Kasita comes with you. Just power up you app, schedule your move from Austin to Chicago, and grab your duffle bag. A crane and a flatbed truck scheduled by Wilson\u2019s team will take care of the rest. Packing? Forget about it.\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nWilson\u2019s vision to provide \u201cattainable\u201d, mobile housing for people moving back downtown and revitalizing many American urban cores has come a long way in the 18 months since it started in a dumpster.\n\u201cI literally tripped out of a dumpster onto the idea for Kasita,\u201d Wilson recalls. \u201cI was an IBM product manager back in the dot com years of the late 1990s and I decided to walk out into the California desert, bury my Rolex , and find something more meaningful to do with my life. I ended up becoming a professor and eventually moving into a dumpster\u201d.\n'Professor Dumpster\" kicking back at home. Courtesy of Kasita\nIn early 2014, Wilson was an environmental studies professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin when he decided to move into a 33-square foot dumpster for a year in an exercise in urban minimalism. While still teaching full-time, Wilson\u2019s goal was to demonstrate that living small wasn\u2019t \u201cun-American\u201d; it was precisely the opposite. Wilson\u2019s decision to sell almost everything and downsize was more liberating than he ever could have imagined. Most importantly, it freed his mind to think.\n\u201cMost nights I\u2019d just stare at the dumpster ceiling,\u201d Wilson recalls, \u201cAnd one night I had the first of two \u2018a-ha\u2019 moments. The first was realizing that smaller spaces could mean better lives. My stuff didn\u2019t own me anymore. I had more income. I could pick up and move my dumpster to another great part of town any time I wanted.\u201d\nCourtesy of Kasita\nWilson\u2019s second a-ha moment was realizing that there were existing stigmas surrounding \u201cmicro housing\u201d. When you say the word \u201cpre-manufactured\u201d most people think of a mobile home, not a tech-stacked, high-design living pod. If you tell my wife a loft has a \u201cMurphy bed\u201d the answer will simply be \u201cno\u201d\u2014because no one, especially my wife, wants to spend ten minutes manually erecting a bed when they just want to go to sleep. \u201cI realized that whatever Kasita was going to be,\u201d Wilson recalls, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a dumpster. It had to be beautiful. It had to be iconic. It had to turn the concept of a home into a brand like a car or a watch.\u201d\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nWhen Wilson climbed out of his dumpster in early 2015, the first person he met with was a former Apple patent attorney, who told Wilson to surround himself with people who knew more than him. As a result, one of Wilson\u2019s first partners was an industrial designer, because he knew that he couldn\u2019t reinvent real estate through architecture alone.\n\"I told him, \u2018I want you to design an iPhone that I can live in that\u2019s like a Tesla to drive\u2019\", Wilson remembers of their first meeting. \"I want you to throw out everything you know about housing\u2014and he didn't know much\u2014and make something truly iconic.\"\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nThe result is 320 square feet of smart-home technology and voice-controlled systems (with 10' ceilings) that can fine tune your interior temperature or dim the \u201cdynamic\u201d glass at night for privacy on command. The robotic kitchen module transforms into a sleek, comfortable queen bed over a mobile app while you\u2019re on your way home\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just make Kasita \u2018smart\u2019\u201d, Wilson explains, \u201cWe wanted people to just talk to the walls.\u201d\nWilson\u2019s other goal with Kasita was to build something that could be infinitely scalable for cities and developers that are struggling to provide attainable housing. The obvious targets are cities like San Francisco and Manhattan, where the whole concept of \u201creasonable housing\u201d is a laughable economic oxymoron. Other markets include providing seasonal housing in ski towns, corporate campus housing for employees or interns (think Google ), and housing for school districts who can\u2019t attract new teachers due to high local rents. Wilson has already met with over two dozen mayors and Kasita \u201ccommunities\u201d are now in the works with developers in over a dozen US cities including Chicago, Houston, Brooklyn, San Francisco, San Diego, and Atlanta.\nCourtesy of Kasita\n\u201cIt you really think about it,\u201d Wilson says, recalling another one of his nights in the dumpster, \u201cThere\u2019s been no disruption to the way we build or how we live for the last 150 years. There\u2019s a zeitgeist now happening in how people look at this, and it\u2019s tapping into other disruptive parts of the sharing economy like Uber and Lyft as well as companies like AirBNB. The kind of model that Kasita represents hasn\u2019t even begun to tap into the changes occurring in the real estate and development space.\u201d\nSo what\u2019s it cost to buy your own Kasita? Wilson is still keeping that under wraps until this fall when the first buyers can start putting down deposits.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just put it this way,\u201d Wilson tells me, \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere between a nice and a very nice Tesla.\u201d But remember we\u2019re talking about your house here.\nFollow me on LinkedIn.

The pseudonym Professor Dumpster is based upon his role as part of 'The Dumpster Project', an educational and minimalist living experiment that transformed a trash dumpster into a fully sustainable home. Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project.\nContents\nJeff wilson professor dumpster\nDr jeff wilson part 1\nKasita\nThe Dumpster Project\nNo Baggage Experiment\n99 Nights Couchsurfing Experiment\nAcademic Work\nReferences\nDr jeff wilson part 1\n\nKasita\nWilson is currently CEO and Co-Founder at the startup company Kasita. Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking. Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award. Wilson has referred to Kasita as a holistic integrated product, rather than a house.\nThe Dumpster Project\nWilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)3 non-profit 'The Dumpster Project', a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home. The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources. The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition, but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal. The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity. On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'. Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators. On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster. Wilson claims that the dumpter experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.\nNo Baggage Experiment\nTogether with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' No Baggage, in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website. New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones to screen write the film based on a book from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen. American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.\n99 Nights Couchsurfing Experiment\nSubsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson, launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces. The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.\nAcademic Work\nWilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States. Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.\nMore Alchetron Topics\nReferences\nJeff Wilson (professor) Wikipedia\n(Text) CC BY-SA\n\n\nSimilar\nAmityville: A New Generation\nIngrid Andersen\nDavid McLeish (rugby union)\n  About Alchetron|Terms|Privacy|Contact|Alchetron \u00a9 2024",

As a part of an experiment and teaching lesson, Dr. Jeff Wilson lived for one year inside a dumpster. According to KSL, the East Austin man left the dumpster he called home on Wednesday, and it was not an easy departure.\nOne would think leaving a home that is just 36-square feet would be a reason to celebrate, but Wilson admitted that he shed a few tears on his last night. He spoke about how he felt this week with the local media.\n\u201cThe last few nights have been really sweet. Identitywise, am I still Professor Dumpster if I\u2019m not living in a dumpster? I don\u2019t know if this is what my mom wanted for her first-born son.\u201d\nProfessor Dumpster is the nickname he earned because of the experiment. His dumpster started off as just a plain trash can, but over the year he and his students added to it. By the end of the year, the dumpster had a \u201cwindow air-conditioning unit, storage under a false floor, a sliding roof with a weather station that takes measurements every five minutes.\u201d\nWilson even painted the walls an eggshell color, and he put up some art on the walls of the dumpster. He also had a small electric heater.\nThe dumpster Dr. Jeff Wilson called home for the last year.\nDuring the past year, he spent 250 nights inside the dumpster. The nights he spent away from it were spent with his daughter or his girlfriend at her home. Asking his girlfriend to spend the night with him for a bit of romance and breakfast in bed in the morning was out of the question.\nAt the start of the year, Wilson had a clear plan in mind. He wanted to show that people could live a \u201cpretty good life in and on a lot less.\u201d He feels like he succeeded with his experiment. Over the past year, he had \u201cmore moments\u201d with less stuff.\nThe dumpster will still have a use in the days and months to come. It will act as the center of an educational project.\nAccording to KHOU, Wilson said, \u201c[W]e are launching what we call a dumpster home school. So under that effort teachers and educators can spend a night in here. Walk home, back to the classroom with curriculum on sustainability about living on less.\u201d\nStudents will have the task of turning to the trash dumpster into a home. Students that stayed in the dumpster already did have one complaint, and that is the dumpster\u2019s weak Wi-Fi signal. Wilson hopes to change that in the future. He revealed that his dream is to have Google Fiber for the dumpster.\nDr. Jeff Wilson has already decided on his next project, and it will not involve a trash can in any way. He is moving up to homes, but the homes won\u2019t be his own. He will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes in Austin. KSL described the plan.\n\u201cThe new project, called 99 Nights ATX, will continue his exploration of the contemporary notion of house and home in Austin, in conventional and unconventional spaces \u2014 not to mention determine where he\u2019s going to live next. It helps that he has just a handful of shirts and a few pairs of shoes \u2014 enough to fit in a bag as he schleps around town, usually on his bike.\u201d\nWith this experiment, he wants to learn a \u201ccomprehensive view of the stories people tell themselves about home.\u201d\nWhat do you think of this professor\u2019s journey?\n[Photos: Professor Dumpster Instagram]\nShare this article: Professor Moving Out Of Dumpster: Texas Man Ends Experiment After One Year\nPopular On Inquisitr\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle Had an Explosive Argument and He Angrily \u2018Snapped at Her'\nMichelle and Barack Obama\u2019s Deeply Embarrassing Moment From Daughter Malia's Prom Night\nBrad Pitt Gifted Ex-wife Jennifer Aniston a $79 Million Home for Her 50th Birthday\nKris Jenner's Ex-Husband Robert Kardashian Was Allegedly Obsessed With 'Kinky' Priscilla Presley\nWhen Marjorie Taylor Greene Was Slammed By Black Women For Her Shirt Bearing the Slogan \"Say Her Name\"\nMore from Entertainment\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of use\nDMCA\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 The Inquisitr.

His students, the Dumpster Team, and Wilson will transform the garbage container into a sustainable house and interactive teaching lab over the next year starting in Fall 2013.\nUpon completion, the mobile lab will tour the United States helping K-12 children understand the need for sustainability in our culture.

Photo by Luis Gramajo\nWe've all been there, wrestling with terrible WiFi and uncomfortable crowds at a place we swore would be amazing to work in. (Looking at you, most of South Austin.) Even in 2024, cell service is not infallible \u2014 and it's especially untenable if uploading photos or keeping lots of tabs open is part of your job.\nA sunnier outlook on any workday is possible at the places we know and love, but if it's time to shake things up, here are our tested recommendations for a minimally disruptive work-from-\"home\" outing.\nIt was most important to us that each spot has reliable WiFi, if not blazing fast. We can wait a few more seconds here and there for some great snacks. We also wanted an option to avoid spending tons of money, not to be rushed out, and to generally fit in with the crowd \u2014 no weirdly bringing computers to popular date spots.\nStill, none of this factored into an official scoring. Each of these spots is just a place we legitimately like visiting.\nWithout further ado, these are CultureMap\u2019s tried and true favorite remote work spots around Austin.\nAll over Austin\nLibraries\nWe\u2019re big fans of supporting your local library, and Austin Public Library's Central branch is the most fun place to work if you want a beautiful view of downtown Austin. There are 20 more library branches throughout Austin, so there\u2019s no shortage of quiet places to get some work done. We also like the Wells Branch Community Library, which is not part of APL. It's a true hidden gem for remote workers thanks to its wealth of indoor and outdoor seating, and very few distractions.\nIn South Austin\nRadio Coffee & Beer\n4204 Menchaca Rd\nIf you're the type to stay all day, Radio is the perfect playground. Surrounded by plants, shade structures, and misters, you might sweat a bit, but feel at peace doing so. Food trucks offer variety, but guests can keep the cost of daily visits down by settling for a cup of coffee or an iced tea. Long operating hours make it possible to hang out at virtually any time \u2014 whether a bluegrass band is motivation or a distraction is up to you.\nUncle Nicky\u2019s\n2121 South Lamar Blvd #100\nEither location \u2014 on South Lamar Boulevard or Duval Street \u2014 is a great place to hang out, but the South Lamar location still has that new sheen, and isn't too busy. Both serve an Italian aperitivo, which in this case is basically a complimentary happy hour snack bar that you can peruse while enjoying a cocktail. Nonalcoholic options are available if a spritz is going to temper your spreadsheet-making abilities.\nOpa\n2050 S Lamar Blvd\nAnother low-key, day-to-night spot is Opa, a Greek restaurant and coffee-and-wine bar also on South Lamar Boulevard. Under a beautiful oak tree, the front yard feels like a vacation. Inside, there are lots of comfy nooks to sit in, often occupied by other people with laptops or in-person collaborators. Since Opa draws artsy, hipster crowds, the open mic nights on Wednesdays are always unique.\nCaptain Quack's Coffeehouse\n5326 Menchaca Rd\nA bakery isn't usually an ideal place to hang around for hours, but Captain Quack's is much more than a bakery. Although we love the Eat Your Feelings cake scrap boxes, remote workers with a little more dietary restraint might enjoy coffee, tea, a cocktail, or some pre-made sandwiches. Captain Quack's also has tons of events in the adjacent \"Soundspace,\" like comedy nights, movie screenings, and karaoke with a live band. For those who haven't finished work when those start, there are some outdoor seats, too.\nIn East Austin\nUptown Sports Club\n1200 E. 6th St.\nWe've said this before: Aaron Franklin's Uptown Sports Club is one of our favorite places to post up with a laptop. It's just the right amount of busy that it feels lively without being overbearing. The unique menu shakes up the usual tacos or sandwich routine with a nice snack menu including cups of thick gumbo and nostalgic ice cream shakes. Most important, it's an island of productivity in the middle of a chaotic street \u2014 a good stepping stone on the way to and from other plans.\nCabana Club\n5012 E. 7th St.\nThe recently opened Cabana Club is perhaps the most trendy remote work destination in the city. Start the day with a coffee, plus breakfast or lunch from the club's convenient walk-up window or bar. If that's not enough options, there are also food trucks on site, including Mr. Pimento Catering & Dining, where we tried a jackfruit plate with tasty jerk sauce. Perhaps more than anything on the list, this feels like a bit like a hotel lobby and a lot like a real co-working space, while still being warm and welcoming. Watch Bob Ross on the TV or finish the day by the (21-plus only) pool with an espresso martini on tap.\nCherrywood Coffeehouse\n1400 E. 38th 1/2 St.\nThis was a favorite hangout spot for the late Austin legend John Aeilli, and we trust his judgment without question. Cherrywood Coffeehouse has great food and beverages to keep remote workers satisfied at any time of day. Plus, there's plenty of space to spread out, whether it be inside or outside on the patio. For Austinites who would prefer to work indoors, a good tip is to keep some earbuds or headphones nearby just in case it gets loud.\nIn Central Austin\nEpoch Coffee\n221 W. N. Loop Blvd\nIf you\u2019re a night owl that gets a sudden burst of energy to work after dark, Epoch Coffee on North Loop is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Inside space can be limited, so working outdoors is pretty typical at this coffee shop. You can't go wrong with any of Epoch's coffee offerings, and it's rare to hear complaints about the shop's WiFi.\nHome Slice Pizza\n501 E 53rd St\nThis pick could be controversial, since unlike Epoch, the Wi-Fi is often taxed by crowds. Still, it does work in quieter parts of the day, and the welcoming pizzeria vibes are worth attempting a personal hotspot now and then. It's also a less-expensive lunch option that still has a great indoor set-up \u2014 something that's rare among Austin's many food truck parks.\nIn North Austin\nNG Cafe\n13000 N. Interstate Hwy 35, Building 12, Suite 200\nNg Cafe\u2019s delicious baked goods and dining offerings made it on our list of favorite meals we ate in 2023, but the qualities that make this neighborhood restaurant one of our absolute favorites include its down-to-earth atmosphere and spacious seating.One thing to note is that Ng doesn\u2019t have guest WiFi, but that hasn\u2019t stopped us from coming back to spend the afternoon working while munching on shortbread cookies and sipping on Thai tea.\nLazarus Brewing Co.\n4803 Airport Blvd\nIt's hard to think of an activity any Austin brewery isn't good for, but Lazarus is enthusiastically used as a workspace, so you won't be the lame laptop jockey while everyone else is having fun. Both locations \u2014 on Airport Boulevard and East 6th Street \u2014 have cool, welcoming designs and Mexican kitchens, making it easy to hang out for the day whether or not beer is part of your unwinding afterward.\nCoco\u2019s Cafe\n8557 Research Blvd, Suite #118\nThis casual Taiwanese restaurant has two locations in Austin, but the north location on Research Boulevard is our go-to when we\u2019re looking for a quick meal or a smoothie while finishing the workday. Coco\u2019s also has open seating, so there\u2019s no expectation to leave after a certain amount of time. Try the Thai tea for a different kind of caffeine punch.\nHarry Potter Forbidden Forest event casts a spell on Austin in fall 2024\nSouth Texan pop-up changes how things are done at Austin food hall\nAustin chef launches cottage bakery devoted to vegan olive oil cake\neditorial series\nWeekend event planner\nHere are the top 7 things to do in Austin this weekend\nHere are the top 7 things to do in Austin this weekend\nHere are the top 7 things to do in Austin this weekend",

The self-proclaimed \"Professor Dumpster\" has been living in what he calls the \"magic boxes\" most people see as nothing more than a place to put their garbage. His motivation? With the help of his students, Wilson wants to take a new approach to the way single-family homes use their resources by maintaining his lifestyle in a sustainable 33-square-foot abode that's roughly 1 percent of the average-sized American house.\nBut his project doesn't quite end there. Over the next six months, Wilson and his team will transform the trash bin into a small version of a typical home before remodeling it to maximize sustainability with features such as solar power and a \"green toilet.\"\n\"We\u2019re going to take all of the lessons we\u2019ve learned from this about design and living in small spaces and we\u2019re going to build the tiniest home to code in the city of Austin,\" Wilson says. \"We want to develop a \u2018how to\u2019 for building the tiniest home possible.\"\nCheck out some photos below.\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\nADVERTISEMENT\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\nADVERTISEMENT\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\nH/T to FastCo.

He's still in the first phase \u2013 or the camping out portion \u2013 of his three phase project. That means no electricity as we hover around 100 degrees.\nIn October we first told you about Professor Jeff Wilson's plans to live in a dumpster for a year. Wilson moved in to his dumpster digs nearly four months later. Now 5-months into phase one of his sustainability project, Wilson is eager to show off some dumpster home amenities.\n\"We've added what you might call a crawl in closet where we've got all of our clothes and some of our bedding there,\" said Doctor Jeff Wilson. Wilson is an environmental science professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University.\nBut he's most proud of two things \u2013 the first usable garden at Huston-Tillotson in nearly 5-decades. He keeps it freshly watered with the condensation that drips from a nearby AC unit. Then it's his crowning accomplishment to date \u2013 a weather station complete with antenna.\n\"It's probably the first weather station that's been strapped to a dumpster,\" said Wilson.\nNow you would expect the weather station to be able to measure the temperature both the inside and outside the dumpster. What you might not be aware of is that it also also measures the moisture content into Wilson's garden. Talk about your ground control to Major Tom. But 5-months in a dumpster have not been without problems.\n\"That heavy rain that we had last week... when you start getting a bit more horizontal rain my basement flooded,\" said Wilson. \"I had about an inch of rain and it was time to get the Wet Vac out.\"\nAnd of course there's the heat.\n\"I have a gauge set up that I can see that fails at 120 (degrees),\" said Wilson. \"It failed the other day. I think the interior temperature the record we're up to 124 [degrees], so I don't hang out here much as you can imagine during the day during July. It has been a cool summer, but it hasn't been a cool dumpster summer.\"\nPhase two -- with electricity and AC -- begins next month.\nGo here for a link to the dumpster project website.\nClose Ad\nAmericans in Singapore can request their ballot via email!\nAmericans living or traveling abroad are eligible to vote in the 2024 elections.

How much does a person really need?\nBy James Hamblin\nSEPTEMBER 11, 2014\nSHARE\nSAVE\nTucked behind the women\u2019s residence halls in a back corner of Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s campus in Austin, Texas, sits a green dumpster. Were it not for the sliding pitched roof and weather station perched on top, a reasonable person might dismiss the box as \u201cjust another dumpster\u201d\u2014providing this person did not encounter the dean of the University College Jeff Wilson living inside.\nProfessor Wilson went to the dumpster not just because he wished to live deliberately, and not just to teach his students about the environmental impacts  of day-to-day life, and not just to gradually transform the dumpster into \u201cthe most thoughtfully-designed, tiniest home ever constructed.\u201d Wilson\u2019s reasons are a tapestry of these things.\nUntil this summer, the green dumpster was even less descript than it is now. There was no sliding roof; Wilson kept the rain out with a tarp. He slept on cardboard mats on the floor. It was essentially, as he called it, \u201cdumpster camping.\u201d The goal was to establish a baseline experience of the dumpster without any accoutrements, before adding them incrementally.\nNot long ago, Wilson was nesting in a 2,500 square foot house. After going through a divorce (\u201cnothing related to the dumpster,\u201d he told me, unsolicited), he spun into the archetypal downsizing of a newly minted bachelor. He moved into a 500-square-foot apartment. Then he began selling clothes and furniture on Facebook for almost nothing. Now he says almost everything he owns is in his 36-square-foot dumpster, which is sanctioned and supported by the university as part of an ongoing sustainability-focused experiment called The Dumpster Project. \u201cWe could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson said at the launch, \u201c[fueled by] sunlight and surface water, and people could have a pretty good life.\u201d\nWilson, known around town as Professor Dumpster, recounted in another recent interview that he now owns four pairs of pants, four shirts, three pairs of shoes, three hats, and, in keeping with his hipsteresque aesthetic, \u201ceight or nine\u201d bow ties. (That's an exceptional bow-tie-to-shirt ownership ratio.) He keeps all of this in cubbies under a recently installed false floor, along with some camping cooking equipment.\nCustomization of the space really began in July. Wilson asked Twitter what was the first thing he needed, and the response was almost unanimous: air conditioning. In the Austin heat, the dumpster was getting up to 130 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. On some nights it did not fall below the high 80s. So on his six-month anniversary of living in a human-sized convection oven, Wilson procured a modest air conditioner.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make it too easy,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI wanted to see how elastic my sleeping habits would be relative to temperature and humidity. I found that I could actually get to sleep pretty well as long as I went to bed at about 11:00 p.m.\u201d\nWilson lectures about his home (Air Media)\nWith the weather station now strapped to the top, Wilson tracks his personal climate in real time. Pulling up data on his computer from inside his centrally cooled office as we spoke, he announced that the dumpster was currently 104 degrees. During the spring, when Austin was a little cooler, he was able to pass some daytime hours in the dumpster. With the arrival of summer, that became unbearable. \u201cBut some interesting things happened because of that,\u201d he explained. He spent a lot more time out in the community, just walking around. \u201cI almost feel like East Austin is my home and backyard,\u201c he said. He is constantly thinking about what sorts of things a person really needs in a house, and what can be more communal.\n\u201cWhat if everybody had to go to some sort of laundromat?\u201d Wilson posited. \u201cHow would that shift how we have to, or get to, interact with others? I know I have met a much wider circle of people just from going to laundromats and wandering around outside of the dumpster when I would\u2019ve been in there if I had a large flat screen and a La-Z Boy.\u201d\nPhase two, currently in progress (Jeff Wilson)\nPerks like insulation will come, allowing the small air conditioner to keep pace with the Texas sun. The second phase of The Dumpster Project, which Wilson and collaborators call the \u201caverage American dumpster studio,\u201d will incorporate more amenities including a bed, a lamp, and a classic home-evoking pitched roof that will slide back and forth to allow ventilation, weather stripping, and locks (making this possibly the only dumpster in the world with interior locks). Eventually, the dumpster will have a dome to catch rainwater and provide shade, as well as a (tiny) sink and kitchen.\n\u201cActually,\u201d he said as we spoke by phone, \u201cit is starting to rain right now, and my roof\u2019s open on the dumpster.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d\n\u201cCan I call you right back? It\u2019s a downpour. I\u2019ll be back in about a minute.\u201d\nHe called me back a minute later, sounding less distressed than one might expect from a person whose home had been drenched. The disposition that might make a person amenable to dumpster life is not one easily troubled by a little rain. His dumpster-home once looked like this:\nThe interior of the dumpster on Wilson\u2019s first night there; emptying the rain tarp; the view through a newly installed window; storage space in the dumpster floor (Jeff Wilson; Air Media; Sarah Natsumi)\nHe\u2019s also welcoming of anyone who wants to stop by the dumpster and talk sustainability any time. In addition to teaching courses in environmental change, global health and welfare, and environmental science at the college, Wilson describes The Dumpster Project primarily as an educational initiative that just happened to dovetail with his current life-downsizing. On some nights, Wilson will stay with a friend, and students from the ecology-focused campus group Green Is the New Black will get a night to stay in the dumpster.\n\u201cWhat does home look like in a world of 10 billion people?\u201d the project\u2019s site implores, referring to the projected 40 percent increase in the human population by the end of the century. \u201cHow do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices?\u201d\nUnfortunately the site does not answer those questions in concrete terms. But with only 39 percent of Americans identifying as \u201cbelievers\u201d in global warming, just raising questions and promoting consciousness of sustainability might be a lofty enough aspiration.\nWater access (Air Media)\nWilson\u2019s most anticipated upcoming boon is a toilet. \u201cI\u2019m not as concerned about the shower,\u201d he said, \u201cbut getting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run.\u201d Currently, he uses facilities at the university\u2019s gym. A toilet and shower will soon connect to the dumpster externally. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,\u201d he explained.\nIn four months Wilson will enter the third phase of the project, the \u201cuber dumpster home.\u201d That will involve installing solar panels and unplugging from the energy grid, as well as completing aesthetic work that will essentially remove any semblance of dumpsterdom. \u201cWe kind of want to do the outside in a modern Dwell look,\u201d he said, including windows and reused lumber siding. \u201cWe want it basically to be such that if you were blindfolded and placed inside it, you\u2019d just think you were in a very tiny house.\u201d\nPhase three, beginning this winter (Jeff Wilson)\nWilson already goes around to local elementary and middle schools recounting his experience in the context of talking about using less space, less energy, and less water, and creating less waste. There is a K\u201312 curriculum built around the dumpster experiment, and eventually the finished dumpster will be transported to these schools for display.\nFor Professor Dumpster, the undertaking is at once grand and diminutive, selfless and introspective, silly and gravely important, even dark. \u201cWe bring everything into the home these days,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to leave the home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home.\u201d\n\u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\nTHIS IS YOUR LAST FREE ARTICLE\nALREADY A SUBSCRIBER?\nSIGN IN\nNever miss a story from The Atlantic.\nGet unlimited access to The Atlantic.\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJames Hamblin, M.D., is a former staff writer at The Atlantic.

For a year, he lived in the 33-square-foot space, set in the school's parking lot.\n\nThe dumpster experiment began when Wilson, a biology professor, and others at the school renovated the structure in the style of a tiny house. Despite indoor temps that ranged from 30 to 130, he seems to have lived quite comfortably most of the time with the help of an air-conditioner, a weather station, and a false floor for clothing storage. No bathroom or shower though. Wilson says the experience taught him how to lead a simpler life.\n\n\n\nWilson's next project will be to crash on 99 couches in Austin in 99 days.\n\nVia The Washington Post.\nCOMMENTS\nHOUSES SIMPLE LIVING\nAround the Web\nUrologist: Many Men With an Enlarged Prostate Do Not Know About This Simple Tric\nTitan Flow\nHeidi Klum's Daughter Looks Like Her Iconic Dad\nlearnitwise\nDoctors Stunned - Do This Every Evening & Lose Your Weight\nPuravive\nThe New Normal of Selling a Home Today\nRing Devices Help Make Peace of Mind More Accessible to All\nGet Mortgage Advice Close to Home\nWoman falls to death through rotten floorboards into 48ft well under home\nAn 83-year-old woman died Sunday while helping her daughter move out of a 100-year-old house in Salem, South Carolina.

My name is Charles Lowell, a developer here at The Frontside and your podcast host-in-training. With me today are Jeff and Jason from Kasita. Now, Kasita is one of the most exciting products that I think we've gotten to work on here at Frontside in the last five years. We're going to be just talking about it because, I think it touches on a lot of the aspects of what makes software development and startups and just the emerging economy exciting.\nI'm really thankful that we get to have you all on the podcast. Welcome Jeff and welcome Jason.\nJEFF: Thanks for having us.\nJASON: Excited to be here. Thanks, Charles.\nCHARLES: Now Jeff, you are the founder of Kasita, the CEO and I believe your official title over there is 'Professor Dumpster.' Maybe you could actually unpack for us a little bit of what does that title mean? How did Kasita come about and what is it today?\nJEFF: A couple of years ago, I did a radical, social experiment around housing. I went and sold everything I own for a dollar an item out of a 3000-square foot house and moved into a 33-square foot used trash dumpster for a year. The idea of that project was to live in 1% the size of an average American home and try to use 1% the energy and water of the average American home.\nThe project took a little bit of a twist, you might say and about part way through it when the dumpster started getting tricked out, I started thinking about the whole nature of housing and how we need to do something different and how that grand future probably would not be a gated community of dumpsters.\nCHARLES: Now, I assume you cleaned out the dumpster before you actually went to live in it.\nJEFF: Yeah, it was a fixer-upper. We give it a bit of a scrub and did some testing to make sure there wasn't anything nasty left in there. That went for about a year and a couple of months after that, I actually first set down with Jason because he was the only person that I knew in the entire startup scene, in the entire world. He said, \"Wilson, you had some crazy ass ideas like this dumpster thing you told me about. This one might actually work, this Kasita thing.\" Here we are today, we're working together.\nCHARLES: Wow. This was something you just did on a lark. You didn't have the idea of starting this business but it was actually through the process of actually living in this dumpster for a year that the idea emerged or was there a master plan going in?\nJEFF: I don't know, Jason do you remember any kind of master plan when I first told you about the dumpster?\nJASON: No. When we first met to talk about the dumpster, it was an early morning, I believe in 2010 or 2011 and you're incubating the idea. At that point in time, there was nothing on your mind or you aren't looking towards the future of housing at all. You were just trying to figure out how you were going to move into a dumpster and people thought you would be crazy. Of course, I've validate it and I thought people would think you would be crazy.\nCHARLES: That is a pretty radical idea, the future of housing being 1% of what it is now. How do you see that playing out? How is that possible? How do you shift people's mindset away from that?\nJEFF: One of the bigger things we're trying to do with Kasita, there needs to be a massive shift in the wider way that we live in our homes. As everything else is moving towards on demand and as a service and as everything's being sort of productized, those are some of the core ideas behind Kasita. We think about Kasita a lot more like an iPhone or a Tesla than we would think about it as a single family home or an apartment block or even a micro-unit. That's why Jason and I are standing together here today is I represent a lot of ways, a kind of vision and origin story of Kasita but in a lot of ways, Jason represents the future of the software and integrated IoT that's going into these things.\nCHARLES: There is definitely a lot going into these things. I remember when Jason first started telling me about it because it is like an iPhone or a Tesla but, I think especially the Tesla is a great analogy because you have not just like a normal software or even really a hardware project, you've got architectural concerns. You've got manufacturing concerns. You've got, I assumed geopolitical concerns in terms of the politics around zoning and housing and real estate, all rolled up into a big startup. When I think startup, I think let's get a web application up and running and we're providing some service. This is cross-cutting at least five industries, it feels like if not more. I'm curious, what's been the experience in terms of wrangling that aspect because I think it is very unique in a startup today but it got me wondering is this going to be the normal in five years?\nJEFF: We've seen a movement recently in the venture community. Even a few years ago when we first started raising money was highly-regulated industries are hard, hardware is hard, \"Thank you very much. We're going to go looking for our next two Stanford computer science dropouts to shove into a wee work and not have to deal with all of this kind of stuff.\" I think I've seen a shift to where people from the individual level up to the folks funding these things, see the massive opportunity in highly-regulated complex problems like housing and you're right. Jason and I are looking out over our shop floor here where we've got guys out there that are plumbers or traditional electricians all the way upstairs here to folks that have been mayor pro tem of large cities with PhDs. Bridging all of those individuals into a startup culture and then looking at the complexity of the landscape from a regulatory standpoint, autonomous cars are a breeze relative to the kind of complexity we're dealing with.\nCHARLES: Did you know this complexity walking in or was it a classic overoptimism?\nJEFF: No, it wasn't classic overoptimism. I'm always asked, \"Are you a designer? Are you an architect? Are you a real estate developer? Are you a technology guy?\" and I think if I would have been any of those besides a guy living in a dumpster, I wouldn't ever been crazy enough to try this.\nIt's one of our core precepts as well. Jason had never worked with IoT stuff before. Our head of manufacturing used to build LEDs for Philips. Our quality guy inspected Cadillacs. Our manufacturing engineer built Boeing jets. The ideas that we're not pulling a lot of people from these traditional industries, we're pulling smart people that are passionate about our mission and to solve this, what is really a Rubik's Cube of a problem.\nJASON: Yeah, I think the other thing to add to that that Jeff is not getting himself enough credit is that from very early on, Jeff always looked at Kasita as a product that was going to incorporate multiple disciplines. He was very careful in how he orchestrate it and built the team to make sure that he was bringing the right expertise and the right areas together and then forcing those different disciplines to figure out how to meld and work together to build the Kasita. But the Kasita was from the beginning just about building a micro-urban home. It was about building a product of which part of that was a home, where people live obviously, but there's a whole lot more to it that we're working towards. I think even go back and Jeff, it might be relevant for you to talk a little bit about the approach that you took to just create an initial design for Kasita, which I think is revolutionary in itself.\nJEFF: A big part of our DNA was product from conception. When I was living in the dumpster, I recruited a couple of the top architects in the country really to help me turn that dumpster into a home. The way you're trained in architecture school, I think a lot of folks come in there with Buckminster Fuller kind of dreams and you're told pretty quick that you better bring things up to code and you better make things that sell or you're not going to eat when you get out of here.\nThe idea was that we would start off with a product designer and not design a home. The kind of struggles in the dumpster taught me that we needed to go at a different approach so I went and recruited an industrial designer. One of the requirements for that person that he or she had never designed a home. This person had lived under a staircase and never designed a home so I said, \"You're perfect.\"\nCHARLES: I like that and I'm curious, Jason from your perspective, what was it like to have gone through this? It sounds like what you're doing is asking people to bring their expertise but not their set of expectations like the industrial designer. What was it like for you coming primarily from the software development world to step into this pan-technological realm and what was that experience like and what were the things that stretched you and you found surprising?\nJASON: I think early on, I realized that it was going to be a bit more challenging maybe than I thought. Really, what it required was me to think outside of my discipline. Obviously, not only from the perspective of what we were doing on the IoT frontend, how we were melding software and hardware together but then going all the way over to the physical building structure and thinking about on a weekly, daily, hourly basis on how we are interacting with the other disciplines.\nAn early example was, and this is one that I remember that's quite funny is one area that we wanted to make sure that we had covered in our research and understanding from IoT perspective was smart locks and how we were going to provide a smart locks for the data. We went out and did a lot of investigation, brought a number of leading smart lock solutions into the lab and tested them and narrow our list down. Then I recall vividly walking over to the architects to excitedly tell them we had selected our smart lock that we were going to use.\nThey very quickly inform me that that lock wouldn't work because we needed a mortise lock and not a standard door lock. I realized that you can't work in a vacuum and just solve your problems. You have to be working together to make sure the solutions and the products you're selecting at work in accord with the overall design. That's continued to manifest itself.\nEvery day, I'm down on the manufacturing floor, working directly with the electricians and others to make sure that our equipment is placed properly, where are we going to place our equipment, how are we routing around plumbing and pipes and other things that exist there and how are we locating things properly. It's an ongoing experience, which has definitely taken me out of my traditional software role but it's done so in a very exciting way and I've enjoyed it. It's just realizing that you have to actively be communicating across the organization with all groups and really, you can't take anything for granted.\nCHARLES: The number of different disciplines and technologies is really staggering, even if you limit it to just considering the set of devices that you're integrating. I was actually hoping we could talk a little bit about that. Now inside each Kasita, at least the ones that you're building right now, how many different devices do you have? How do you take all these different devices and turn them into a product or integrate them into something that itself is one product?\nJASON: If you were just to look at the technology bill of materials, what the products are that we're incorporating into our current Kasita design, there is around 50 different products and product parts that we're bringing together to build out the technology solution. If you narrow that down to what the end user is actually seeing and looking at, there are about seven noticeable products that the end user would see or they would recognize everything from a Sonos connecting amplifier to an Amazon Dot to a Nest Thermostat.\nObviously, getting to that list of bill of materials and deciding on that 'subassembly of technology pieces,' took us quite some time in a number of iterations and a lot of outside engagement and talking to experts and trying to decide what were the best devices to bring in. But the other side of the equation was something that we kind of decided very early on in the process and kind of thinking the world of first principles was that, we wanted to make sure that Kasita was the primary interface to the user. We didn't want somebody else sitting between us and the end user. We wanted to be able to work with other products but we still felt at the end of the day that the end user, when they were living inside of a Kasita, when they were controlling the Kasita, when they were changing the state of the Kasita, they needed to go through our interface.\nWith that as an initial first principle, you can begin to imagine that all the other parts of the system architecture and the way that we design things, the way that we select products and built things, it begin to derive themselves. Everything from that, immediately we needed an app and lo and behold. We were able, fortunately to work with you guys, the Frontside, to help us get our initial app concept up and going. It went from there and I can talk more about it.\nCHARLES: I think I really like that as a first principle. I really just want to inject a vigorous sense of agreement because I think it's so important, especially when this is the place where you're living. You want to imbue that inhabitant with a sense of ownership and control. I don't know if you would be able to do that if there were a bunch of different touch points and it didn't feel integrated under one product. In other words, this is my home, this is my Kasita. Is that the idea behind making sure that there was really only one interface?\nJEFF: We prefer to say 'Mi Kasita.'\nCHARLES: I love it.\nJASON: Absolutely, that's the idea. I think from a consumer perspective, if you've ever personally gone out and ventured through the halls of Home Depot or Best Buy and purchased some smart products off the shelf and brought them into your house and try to get them up and running, you very quickly learn that. It's not only challenging to get these devices connected in a way that you can control them but there's also this notion of there's an app for that. Every physical device you ended up putting in your how, has its own app for control and that becomes very overwhelming in a very short amount of time for the user.\nWe did not want that to be the case with the Kasita. We wanted them to walk in the door from day one and immediately feel at home and feel like they have complete control of the Kasita, in much the same way when you go purchase an iPhone or you purchase a new Garmin watch or you purchase a new Android device, you're up and running with that ecosystem and you're interacting with that interface. We wanted people to be interacting with the Kasita interface to control their home because that's part of the product.\nCHARLES: I like that. It must present some unique challenges because I think you said it best. Every single device that you have comes with its own ecosystem and that ecosystem has its own APIs, its own web interfaces, its own applications and though there are walls around those ecosystems, what are some of the challenges you encounter in trying to punch holes through those walls so that you can hand information and control from one ecosystem to the other while providing a seamless experience to the user?\nJEFF: When you're talking about that, Jason one of the things that is often left out of this equation is at this specific point in space-time, it's very difficult to do that. But then to have any sort of semblance of planning for the future and future-proofing the system as developers usually call it, one of the reasons why you don't see a lot of Nest thermostats in multifamily development is because a developer knows that they're not going to ever have to replace a normal light switch. If it's a Lutron switch or if it is a Nest thermostat at some point, it's going to have to be replaced. Not only the physical replacement of the stuff but from a software side, making sure that we can continue to communicate with these devices in the future, I think is a big problem to solve.\nJASON: That's absolutely right. I think very early on, we recognize and realize that we were going to have to build software and a component that acted, if you will as a gateway for sitting between the end user and the end devices and facilitated the control of the end devices. Obviously, being able to accomplish that, one of the challenges is and I think, Charles you've seen this in your world because I know you've got experience with IoT is this whole proliferation of standards and protocols like if we're going to talk to the lightbulb or we're talking via Z-Wave or ZigBee, or do we have to go through a Philips Hue hub because that's the only way to actually communicate with it. Is there a separate way via Thread or Bluetooth you communicate with this device?\nIn a very quick fashion, you get to this point where you can imagine that you've got a physical hardware controller that has four different radios in talking to four different device types. One for talking to Z-Wave, one for talking to ZigBee and it becomes overwhelming. We did a lot of research across the protocols that were available, mapping them across the devices. Early on, we were excited about the potential of Z-Wave but more recently, where we've shifted our attention quite honestly is looking for devices and device manufacturers who see the opportunity and Wi-Fi enabling their hardware devices and then providing either direct control of those devices in an IP-centric way over a local area network or even through the cloud.\nWhat that affords us back to Jeff's future-proofing concept is if you have Wi-Fi up and running and the device can get on the Wi-Fi network and there's a way to communicate with it, then it makes it a lot easier for us to sit between the user and that device and send commands and control that device. The other side of that, which I think continues to be a challenge and will be a challenged for the foreseeable future is a lot of the device manufacturers to the point that you brought up are still forcing you to go through the cloud to communicate with their devices. They don't allow for a local area network communication directly with the device and there's good reasons for doing that. But what that means is if you lose internet connectivity, you no longer have control of that device.\nCHARLES: Obviously, you've got probably pretty strict criteria about what it takes for a device to be integrated with Kasita. Is that a nonstarter right there?\nJASON: It's actually not. A nonstarter with be the device communicates via protocol that we can't interface with or the device works over a Wi-Fi network but has no API for controlling cloud or local. The third piece of that equation and fundamentally is the final nonstarter and really probably should be the first one and it's one that we take into consideration every time is that there should be a physical override for the user if internet connectivity is lost. What I mean by that is if we select a smart switch and the smart switch goes offline and there's no more connectivity, the user has still be able to walk to the wall and press the power button and the light should come on.\nThere always has to be an ability for the user to fall back to the same old fashioned physical control in the absence of Internet connectivity or local area network connectivity. But the primary things are ability to fall back to physical control, ability to communicate over Wi-Fi or standard IP-based protocol, then the third one would be some form of API access, either remotely via the cloud or locally via the local area network.\nCHARLES: Wow, that's actually a great list. It's got me wondering, obviously you've encountered devices that have fallen on both sides of that divide. Do you feel like that's just a blip and we're going to be trending more towards devices that are happily and easily integrated or are we still seeing some moving and jostling as people maybe try and corner little parts of the market and make their device deliberately make it not easy so that you'll try and force people into that ecosystem?\nJASON: The latter, however we have two guerillas in the market right now that I think are helping drive the other direction in the way of Amazon and Google with Google Home and Amazon Echo. What they're doing is they're saying, \"If we sit in the center and one of the interfaces for voice control for the user to control their home, then we're only going to work with devices that we can communicate with and that we can control through the cloud,\" and quite frankly, what that does is it puts the burden back on the device manufacturer.\nYou could actually say three if you threw Apple in there. I don't want to leave Apple out with HomeKit. But my point is that the device manufacturer now has to find a way that the end device can either communicate via standard TCP/IP network-based connectivity that we all know and love from a developer community perspective or they have to insert a hub into the equation that can handle that form of communication and then communicate over its own proprietary wireless connection, which is in the case of Philips Hue, it's exactly what they do.\nJEFF: I would draw analogies here to some people get really tired of this, particularly the real estate people of me talking about the iPhone but that kind of leap into and integrated piece of hardware and software. There were certain things happening in 2007 that didn't make the iPhone or something like it, something that might happen but something that had to happen. This kind of cold death to the universe that we could see with all of these walled-off ecosystems, go in their directions and iterating into a space to a nobody owns anything and nothing talks, I think Kasita is a solution to that to where we're looking like combine all this stuff under one roof and build a single user experience, much like not having to pull your Palm Pilot out of one pocket, you're Rio MP3 player out of another and you're your Razor or whatever it was out of the other like integrating into a single experience, rather than a sort of convenience, which is what a lot of the IoT spaces right now in these walled-off ecosystems.\nCHARLES: That actually makes a lot of sense and clarifies it in my mind quite a bit. It clarifies one thing but then, immediately raises new questions. When the iPhone first came out, you had a set of basic integrations between your MP3 player and your web browsing and your calling and calendaring, so and so forth. Then, I don't know what was it like, a year and a half later, they actually came out with an SDK so that you could actually develop apps -- third-party developers could actually develop. Sell and distribute in apps -- to the iPhone. We're all really happy with the way that worked out.\nI guess my question is does this analogy carry forward then also for Kasita? Is there a future where you have third-party developers who are actually selling integrations or apps that would run on this integrated IoT product that is Kasita or am I stretching the analogy too far?\nJASON: I think the analogy is good with the exception that we're not looking to control the entire IoT ecosystem in a way that Apple maybe had look to control the mobile phone ecosystem with providing all of that in one box and the iPhone. We want to work with numerous hardware providers and even from that perspective, numerous folks that want to provide interfaces into our system. As we develop an architected Kasita technology system, we've taken an API-first approach and that's allowed us to build our user application layer right on top of that API but in the future, we see the opportunity to work with third-party developers to extend that, up on that and build their own interfaces to the end user.\nThen on the other side of the equation, if you think about what's actually controlling the devices, we're architecting that system in a way that a hardware manufacturer could take an SDK and add Kasita support for their product directly in and make it plug and play when it gets to the Kasita. We definitely see the opportunity, Charles to reach out and allow everybody to be part of this. We consider it quite frankly, a necessary thing. But we don't also want to pretend that we would look to control the whole ecosystem because we just don't have that level of scale, if you will.\nJEFF: And you know --\nCHARLES: Not yet.\nJEFF: Yeah, and we try to keep our ego in the dumpster, so to speak as well.\nCHARLES: What would a third-party app even look like in the context of Kasita? Have you thought of like what are some things that you might be able to do?\nJEFF: If you don't want to call it directly an app, I think the first stage -- Jason and I haven't talked about this -- maybe more like an Alexa Skill to where you can have the Kasita do certain sets of tasks around a particular experience, which we're already building into the system the idea of moods but I don't know in terms of apps.\nJASON: Yeah, it's actually a really good idea. Even though we haven't talked about it, it always scares me a little bit when my boss is coming up with ideas on the fly that we have to implement but --\nJEFF: But actually we will have our first -- we're going to call it a skill app, a Kasita skill app. We'll be releasing that say, October 1st.\nCHARLES: You heard it here first, folks.\nJASON: To take Jeff's idea a little further, I think that is an interesting concept when you think about the Kasita as being an end product and you provide interfaces whether it's the ability for people to write skills that tie into the Amazon Echo or an IFTTT-type capability. The Kasita, as a whole can be controlled -- all the lighting, the sound, all the different temperature, etcetera -- so now you're asking end users to write skills, to control the entire state of the building or of the home and not just doing it on a one-off basis writing skill to turn this light on and off or set the thermostat to this level. You basically box all of that together and make it much easier for people to get from Point A to Point B through our system.\nJEFF: Could you say that we're turning the entire Kasita into a board for people to play with, like treat the Kasita as your breadboard?\nJASON: I think there is some opportunity for that to the degree that will allow the user to have that much flexibility on the hardware side. I think it is still up for question but I think there's a lot of opportunity there, Charles and not only inside of the Kasita but then you can begin to see other applications as Kasita begin to multiply and people use them from many purposes. Let's take a sample of somebody owns 10 Kasitas and they use them as Airbnb properties and they allow users that live in Kasitas to come in for a short period of time into their Kasita and bring their Kasita profile with them. Immediately, they can make the Airbnb Kasita feel exactly like their Kasita feels when they're at home. Those are some interesting opportunities and ways that we see this technology potentially evolving.\nCHARLES: So it will have the same moods, the same behaviors. Any customizations or third-party extensions would also be in effect provided they were software-based?\nJASON: Yep.\nCHARLES: That would actually be quite amazing. I guess the other question I have in terms of hackability of Kasita is we're very interested in the IoT space and very interested in these products and we have some side projects here at Frontside also like I do a bunch of hobby stuff at home, where I try to integrate a bunch of these things. But one of the things that I really like about what you all are doing is that it's very much 'omakase' in the sense of there's an option of 10 smart locks, there's an option of this thermostat, there's an option of a million different devices but what we've done or what you've done is selected ones that we know are going to work well together.\nWe've built the software, the control systems, both computer control systems and human control systems to get them to work together as a cohesive product. I would love to do is say, \"I would just like to buy that product for my house,\" even though my lame tinkerings with smart switches, smart locks and audio controls and lighting, which are fun and gratifying the first few times but they don't really play nice together, give you that super sweet feeling.\nJEFF: This goes to the overall philosophy of Kasita. We want a turnkey, one-click housing solution. Not only for finding you a place to rent so that you're not fishing around on Craigslist for roommate or having to pay some outrageous fee in New York. You don't have to go mattress shopping. At some point, you should just have to show up with your iPhone and your toothbrush. When you start thinking about the technology inside, it's almost like folks don't really care what kind of Foxconn chip is in their iPhone or even if it was Foxconn that put it there, they just want it to work and they want it to be seamless and turnkey.\nIt sets up a whole philosophy around, not only our smart kid in the Kasitas but it shouldn't even be a smart kid anymore. At some point, it should just be an experience so ultimately, what sort of UX inside of the Kasita are all of these things bringing you. I shouldn't have to really look at a blue glowing dot that lights up every time I walk by it to be at a comfortable temperature in my house. I shouldn't need a black tube over on my desktop that I yell commands at. I just talk or it should anticipate those actions. That's a future that I look forward to in Kasita to where we move away from having to tinker with devices and even knowing what those devices are to a true-like depth of experience.\nCHARLES: I like that a lot. Now, one thing that we haven't covered. We touched on it a little bit at the very beginning of the show when we talked about people feeling in control and feeling like they're truly the owner of the space is the issue of privacy. Obviously, there's a lot of a user's behavior that's going to be passing through software channels as their intentions move through the devices in the Kasita. Of course, all of these devices, they have their own ecosystems, their own vendors so how do you ensure that people's data is going to be protected, especially as it moves through potentially a bunch of different public clouds.\nJEFF: Yes, we gave a lot of thoughts to this. Actually, Jason put me on to this book called 'Data for the People' by Andreas Weigend. We took some inspiration on that, from that and set out on what we call it the four cornerstones of this future of the connected home. Those are agency, transparency, security and then the actual benefit that you get from this home. I gave a talk at South by called, 'The final frontier of AI is in your living room.' If that isn't black mirror, creepy enough to attract enough people, I don't know what is.\nIn that talk, I won't take them out of order. First, we need to make sure that we're focused on transparency. Do people know what's actually being collected on them? I've been toting around my iPhone for 10 years. I'm pretty sure they know everywhere that I have been since then. I'm not really all that sure. Second, agency. Can I actually do something about it? Are we allowing people the ability to switch off, switch on, control where that data goes?\nThen third, security. Are we providing another level of security above what you would get out of the box? I'll let Jason talk about that in a minute. Then, the last is benefit. Am I getting ads? Am I getting a slightly better news feed focused on ads or am I getting my rent subsidized? Am I getting a better user experience, better sleep within the connected home? Those are the ways that we think about that in a bigger level.\nCHARLES: Is the idea that there's no benefit than it's exploitative? You want to make sure that there's benefit?\nJASON: Yeah, I think that onus is if you taking individual data and using it, then the onus is on you as a data collector to try to provide benefit back to the end user. If you can't do that, then I think the question should be why are you collecting the data in the first place? our goal is really looking at it from the perspective of if we know when users are turning lights on and off and what they're setting the temperature in their house to and when they're going to sleep at night, when they're waking up because we know when they turn everything off and turn it back on --\nJEFF: Or where this things on the floor are from the vacuum robot.\nJASON: Yeah, exactly. If we have insight into that information, how are we taking that information and combining it in a valuable way that benefits the end user? I think that's the first question that we have to ask when we start looking at the data that we're collecting. But at the same time as Jeff said, that data collection really has to be based on this notion of agency, transparency and privacy or security. An agency is simply I have control over whether my data is collected. Transparency, from the perspective of I understand how my data is being used and where it's being sent and then of course, security, I know that my data is being securely transmitted and stored.\nWhen you think about security, we spend a lot of time thinking about not only the data at rest -- once it's been collected is it properly being stored and encrypted and protected -- but then how is that data being transmitted and are we putting the proper fail safes in place to make sure that somebody else can easily gain access and take control of my home and of the things that are important to me by finding back doors into the system and ways to breach them? Those are the cornerstones that we think about and we put first and foremost in our mind as we build out our architecture, build out our system and as we begin to take that data and to turn it back in useful and interesting ways for the end user.\nCHARLES: I think that's really important. I think it's a great comfort to hear that you all have a framework for thinking about this so that it's going to be integrated into every aspect of it. I think it's just so important, especially when it's something as critical as the space in which you're living. It's good to hear that it's not just an afterthought but that it's something that's been integrated from the start.\nWell, Jeff, Jason thank you guys so much for coming by and talking with us. I really think that Kasita is an exciting product and I think that it was an exciting project, certainly for us to get to work on, even though we were only seeing a very small sliver of it. We still got to perceive the whole enchilada that you guys were working on and see that just what a unique startup that really is, not just you're moving outside of software, integrating a bunch of different devices, integrating that with a unique home that's going to be designed, architected, manufactured and then thinking, then even rolling it up a degree further about how is this going to be integrated into the urban spaces in which we live.\nI hope that we see more startups that really engaged all those different disciplines. I think that with the technological changes that are happening, that's more and more a possibility. The price on software, the price on materials, the price on these smart devices is all coming down so it really enables people to take on scopes that might have been just completely impossible, even with someone who's overly optimistic. I hope that people look to it as an inspiration and it really was a great project for us to work on. I also understand that if someone does want to jump into this space and get involved, you all are hiring.\nJEFF: That's right. We are hiring for a broad range of positions. We're expecting to be doing a lot, more hiring soon. You can go to Kasita.com/Work and at the bottom of the page, you can also see that we have an open house here in Austin every Thursday morning from 9:30 to 11:30. The folks can come in and check out the crib.\nCHARLES: All right. Fantastic. I certainly really enjoyed getting the tour the space, what was that? Back in March? When you revealed the baby units?\nJEFF: Yeah, it was March at South by.\nCHARLES: Yeah, it's really something to see. If you are in Austin or you live here, take the time, go see it. It's really cool. With that, I guess we'll wrap it up. Thank you everybody for listening and as always, you can get in touch with us at @Frontside on Twitter or Frontside.io or send us an email at Contact@Frontside.io.

It\u2019s not what it sounds like: Wilson is an environmental science professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, and he\u2019s working with his students and a team of experts to transform that dumpster into a sustainable home that costs under $10,000.\nHe uses the alter-ego \u201cProfessor Dumpster.\u201d\n\u201cProfessor Dumpster will be spending one year in a dumpster that is approximately 6 feet x 6 feet, or about 1% the size of the average new American home. Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the \u2018new 1%\u2019 will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home,\u201d reads The Dumpster Project website.\nWe first came across Wilson over at The Atlantic, where they describe his downsizing from a 2,500-square-foot house to a 500-square-foot apartment and finally to the 36-square-foot dumpster. For reference, that\u2019s 152 square feet less than the self-proclaimed \u201cworld\u2019s smallest house\u201d in London, 204 square feet less than a typical $30,000 tiny house, and 92 square feet smaller than the tiny house in which a Business Insider reporter spent the weekend with her mom.\nWe were so intrigued by Wilson\u2019s project that we reached out to Team Dumpster to see if it had photos to share. We\u2019ve published them here with the group\u2019s permission.\nThe Dumpster Project will be completed in three phases, starting when Wilson took occupancy in February 2014: camping in a bare-bones dumpster (shown here); living in a dumpster \u201chome,\u201d with additions such as storage and a bed; and then fine-tuning the dumpster into the ultimate sustainable home.\nSign Up for the National Weekly Newsletter\nSIGN UP\nNow, the dumpster is starting to look a little more like home.\nHere, you can see its garden beds, mailbox, and sole window.\nThis photo was taken from the dumpster\u2019s sole window, which also functions as the door.\nIn the third and final stage, which hasn\u2019t yet begun, the team will continue adding to the home with a focus on making sure it uses 1% of the energy and water used in of the average American home.\nTAGS\nMicro-units\nTop stories\nALL MARKETS\nSAN FRANCISCO\nOpenAI exits San Francisco HQ after Elon Musk stops paying rent\nSOUTH FLORIDA\nBoca Raton couple siphoned over $40M from investors in a real estate fraud, SEC alleges\nSOUTH FLORIDA\nDetails, renderings revealed for billionaire Ken Griffin\u2019s $1B Miami supertall\nNEW YORK\nSerhant veteran jumps to Brown Harris Stevens\nRecommended\nALL MARKETS\nCapstone Equities eyes office-to-apartment conversion in Encino\nSecond investor sues OC Ventures for $3M debt on Greektown complex\nVelocis wants mediation with oppositional suburbs Bee Cave, Lakeway\nFormer Padres owner John Moores sells Pebble Beach home for $45M\nGeyser Group scores $28.5M construction loan in East Austin\nTop stories delivered to your inbox\nFEATURED\nCOMMERCIAL\nRESIDENTIAL\nWEEKLY\nNATIONAL\nCHICAGO\nDAILY\nCHICAGO\nLOS ANGELES\nVIEW ALL NEWSLETTERS\nSIGN UP\nRecommended For You\nNEW YORK\nAUG 12, 2024\nBrandon Miller\u2019s widow lists debt-ridden Hamptons estate for $15M\nBrandon Miller\u2019s widow aims to sell the heavily-mortgaged Water Mill property that provided a dreamy backdrop for her Instagram feed.\nNEW YORK\nJUL 4, 2024\nDeveloper Brandon Miller in intensive care\nObituaries for developer Brandon Miller, possibly AI-generated, circulated online even though he was alive in a Southampton hospital.\nNEW YORK\nAUG 23, 2024\nChelsea development stuck in limbo because Brandon Miller died without a will\nA friend who lent Brandon Miller $1.5 million is stuck in limbo because Miller apparently died without a will.\nNATIONAL\nAUG 24, 2024\nStarwood seeks to hold Joel Schreiber in contempt of court\nStarwood has been unable to collect debt from New York real estate investor Joel Schreiber\nSOUTH FLORIDA\nAUG 20, 2024\nMiami International Mall\u2019s market value plummets to $159M\nMiami International Mal\u2019s market value took a nosedive to $159 million, compared to a decade ago.\nABOUT US\nCONTACT US\nPRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nSUBSCRIBE\nCORPORATE SUBSCRIPTIONS\nADVERTISE\nHELP CENTER\nCAREERS\nSHOP\nAll rights reserved \u00a9 2024 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.\n450 West 31st Street, New York, NY 10001 Phone: 212-260-1332\nTRD AI Chatbot",

The reason for his unusual nickname? He has decided to live in a dumpster for the next year - Yes, the kind that you might find filled with trash behind a restaurant or in an alley.\nWilson says the inspiration to do something this radical first hit him two years ago, when he was working on an article at a neighborhood coffee shop and caught sight of an eight-yard dumpster. So when his apartment lease ran out a year later, the professor sold all of his possessions and spent the next seven months sleeping in his office, while he searched for a suitable trash can.\nNow that he has found one, Professor Dumpster is putting his students to work. After all, the point of this project isn't just to spend his life living out of a garbage can: there is, a much greater purpose involved. As an environmental scientist, the professor constantly ponders about sustainable living and how every person should try minimize his/her impact on our already stretched resources. That, is the challenge Wilson wanted his students to step up to, this entire year.\nUsing their math, science, engineering, and technology skills he wants them to retrofit his 33 square-foot dumpster into a modern space that includes a shower, toilet, kitchen and bed and is fitted with amenities like air-conditioning and even WiFi. The one caveat? It all has to be 'green' and sustainable.\nSome important things Wilson's students will have to consider are how to retrieve water, harness energy and keep a healthy living space. To live in this dumpster comfortably, the Professor will need filtered water for drinking, cooking, as well as, for other everyday activities like the toilet and shower. While this is not that big a deal, given that the dumpster has to be sustainable means that the used water has to be recycled as efficiently as possible. In order to ensure that the professor remains healthy there also needs to be adequate ventilation, as well as, cooling and heating systems that function efficiently, without utilizing too much energy or space.\nWhile this may sound like an impossible task, the students are stepping up to the challenge and seem to be figuring it all out. By incorporating solar panels for lighting and electricity, nano-insulation to regulate temperature, and \"energy-producing\" toilets, they plan to create a \"net zero\" model. That means that the dumpster-home will only consume as much energy as it produces. Innovative systems are also being developed for water filtration, climate control, and waste reduction, resulting in what will eventually be a comfortable living space where nothing is wasted. Meanwhile, the professor has already moved into his bare-bones home where he spends the nights 'hanging out' inside a sleeping bag on the floor - quite literally, given that he is 6'1\".\nWhen completed, Wilson's new home will boast some pretty impressive statistics - At 33 square feet the compact home will use zero electricity, just 4 gallons of water per day and apparently produce close to zero trash. In contrast, an average 2,480 square-feet American home uses about 9,500 Kilowatts of energy per month and spends 400 gallons of water and generates 4.5 pounds of trash per day!\nSo why is Wilson planning to go through such hardship? Because he wants to equip his students with the tools to survive in a world that is rapidly heading towards a population of 10 billion people. A world in which resources and space are going to be so restrained that a large majority of the population may have to adjust to living in tighter spaces.\nBy promoting awareness and education on these subjects, Wilson is helping students everywhere see that living \"small\" and sustainably is certainly possible. And while the dumpster project may seem a little melodramatic to some, the professor thinks of it as a \u201cplayful and imaginative\u201d educational experiment and conversation-starter to discuss the fact that all of us can do with less as we move into the future.\nThe scientist is of course is not planning to spend his entire life in this dumpster - Just over a year during which time he will tour the country, visiting schools and teaching kids about sustainable living. Given that the professor is planning to do that stealthily, be sure to keep an eye out and investigate if a relatively clean-looking dumpster suddenly shows up on your playground - Professor Dumpster might just be lurking inside!\nWilson is not the first person to have come up with this idea. California designer Gregory Kloehn has already refurbished a dumpster into a luxury home and now regards it his 'home away from home' for whenever he visits New York. While his may not be as sustainable as the one that the professor is planning to create, judging from the video below, it sure is cool.\nResources: dumpsterproject.org,mnn.com,grist.org,fastcoexist.com,curbed.com\nCite Article\nMLA\nChicago\nAPA\nLearn Keywords in this Article\nPlay Game\n548\nComments (548)\nPost comment\nC and C\n11 years ago\nWho would live In a dumpster?\nReply\n0 Likes\nlioness12\n11 years ago\ni wonder if he has air freshener?\nReply\n0 Likes\nlioness12\n11 years ago\ni ve heard of dumpster diving,but dumpster living???????? cool but bit exetreme.\nReply\n0 Likes\nhi\n11 years ago\nI agree we should ALL live in a dumpster\nReply\n0 Likes\nFreehawk324\n11 years ago\nIt's actually ironic how easy it would be to live in a large dumpster if you have the right supplies!\nReply\n0 Likes\nFreehawk324\n11 years ago\nThat's my dream home\nReply\n0 Likes\njojo\n11 years ago\nwe should all live in dumpster\nReply\n0 Likes\njojo\n11 years ago\nsweet\nReply\n0 Likes\nseagull soars\n11 years ago\nthis is really cool\nReply\n0 Likes\nman huoter\n11 years ago\nthat is crazy cool\nReply\n0 Likes\nShow More\nPopular Articles\nWeek\nMonth\nYear\nRare Orange Lobster Rescued By Restaurant Employee\nElephants Assign Unique \"Names\" To Each Other, Just Like Humans\nCenturies Old Preserved Fruit Unearthed At George Washington's Home\nRoman Beach Buried By Mount Vesuvius's Eruption Now Open\nScream For Ice Cream !

When Jeff Wilson aka Professor Dumpster spent a year living in a used dumpster, a social experiment that reduced the definition of \u201chome\u201d to a 33 square foot extreme, a concept emerged. While the dumpster was, in many ways, an impractical dwelling, there were a surprising number of perks: it could move anywhere; rent was low; commutes were short; and the local neighborhood became an intimate living room.\nAs the experiment drew to a close, Wilson took what he\u2019d learned and returned to the drawing board where Kasita came to life, a new category of home that married iconic design and pioneering technology with insights gleaned from a trashcan.\nThe Kasita is 208 square feet with 10-foot ceilings and is designed to not only feel spacious and full of light, but to be fully equipped with all the amenities you would find in a traditional home or apartment\u2014and then some. In addition to a walk-in shower, refrigerator, and convection oven the design team have also thrown in a dishwasher, washer/dryer combo, cooktop, and a queen size bed that easily tucks away out of sight (without having to even make it).\nYour Kasita will welcome you home by adjusting the A/C, bringing up the lights and shades, and queueing your favorite playlist. Or, ask your Kasita to do something else (like rolling out the bed) via hands-free voice commands throughout.\nKasita\u2019s unique tile system allows for virtually infinite customizations and options for the home while maintaining order and function.\nSave\nThe best part (in my humble opinion) is that the apartments are expected to rent at half of the market rate for a studio. The company expects to have Kasitas on the ground in Austin in 2016 and they are exploring rollout in ten additional cities (including one international city) starting in 2017.\nSpend your money on life \u2014 not rent. Through partnerships with local entities, Kasita will rent units at about half the market rate of a studio apartment. In Downtown Austin, that\u2019s about $600 a month.\nKasita is the smallest home built for the city. Its tiny size presents almost limitless opportunities for location.\nSend it my way!\nContact Us \nPrivacy Policy\nAbout Us \n\u00a9 Livinginashoebox.com",

When you hear this, your mind might automatically visualise a homeless man, or so I assume. But this is not the case, Jeff chose to live in a dumpster to escape his conventional, consumerist and comfortable lifestyle.\nAccording to the Washington Post, before his dumpster days, he was living in a comfortable, 3,000 square-foot home in Texas, with a walk-in closet, a grand and accessible bathroom and a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. He worked as a professor at a state university, he commuted one hour to work everyday and had \"a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\"\nAnd now, he has none of those things and has never been happier! So what changed?\nHe received a new job as an associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson Univsersity in Austin, and lived in a dumpster on the college campus for a year until he vacated last month.\n\u201cAS A WAY OF HAVING A BETTER LIFE, I DECIDED TO MOVE INTO A DUMPSTER.\u201d\n- JEFF WILSON TOLD THE POST\nHe decks out the dumpster pretty well, complete with air-conditioning, a mailbox and false-floor storage space. The challenge was done to prove that people don't need a big home packed with endless possessions to be happy, and they exist!\nThe immediate benefits were obvious to Wilson, they included lower rent, lower utility payments, less time spent doing chores, shorter commute (90 seconds on foot) and less money spent on unnecessary possessions.\nBecause of his much smaller living space, Wilson told the post that he spent a lot less time at home. Instead, he hung around on campus ACTUALLY speaking to people and interacting with other human beings.\nAccording to the Washington Post, \"There are all these studies that say the broader and deeper your social network is, not only does it create more happiness, but it increases your life span,\" Wilson said. \"In the modern home you can have a cradle to grave experience. Your doula can pop you out in the living room, you can get an MIT education online, order food from outside and then work from home until you die in the living room watching your flat screen TV.\"\nWilson had to give up almost all of his possessions. Among the few possessions he purchased while living in the dumpster were a garden gnome and a small air conditioning unit, as the dumpster reached scorching hot levels inside.\nFrom his dumpster experiment Wilson also learnt the detriment of noise, and how it keeps us from looking for a meaningful life.\n\"You can't be aware enough to watch for meaning if you're buried in e-mails or facing a barrage of direct messages on Twitter,\" he told The Post. \"You don't have the bandwidth or the time or the attention to watch. You're looking, but watching is a different exercise.\"\nThe dumpster project allows all of us to really think about the stuff we own and what we rely on, or what we THINK we need. If we take a leaf from Professor Dumpster's book then we can see just how little we need to be happy, and that human interaction and experiences are what create purpose... not things.\nImages credited to Sarah Natsumi More and Jeff Wilson\nDid you like this post?\nThen join us in taking practical climate action to live better for us and for the planet.\nJoin 1 Million Women\nCARBON\nCHALLENGE\n704,728,747,935\nTONNES OF CO2\nSAVINGS PLEDGED\nCan you cut 1 Tonne of carbon pollution out of your life?\nTake the challenge\nSUBSCRIBE TO\nOUR NEWSLETTER\nTo get a notification when new blog articles come out\nSubscribe\nSHEA HOGARTH\nFORMER INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT\nSUGGEST AN ARTICLE SEND US AN EMAIL\nPOPULAR BLOG ARTICLES\nWeaving a home...how one woman can help millions of people globally\n19th Aug 2015\n8 Single-Use Items to Ditch From Your Life\n18th Feb 2015\nThis alien-like creature will break your heart when you find out what it really is...\n18th Mar 2015\nCONTACT US\nPRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS OF USE\n\u00a9 COPYRIGHT 1 MILLION WOMEN\n  1",

That\u2019s exactly the question that project lead, Jeff Wilson, asked while staring at a dumpster in a Starbucks parking lot over two years ago. Wilson, an environmental science professor and dean at Huston Tillotson, will be collaborating with students, scientists, engineers and the wider community by taking a used dumpster and retrofitting it into one of the world\u2019s smallest sustainable homes over the course of a year. He\u2019ll be living in the dumpster from start to finish and as the dumpster evolves, the student dorms and wider campus will also undergo a major eco-upgrade.\n\nThe Dumpster Project aims to start a conversation around the idea of \u201cless is more\u201d by taking a creative and engaging route instead of a preachy one. Wilson and his students are suggesting that you can be a normal American\u2014drive a car, work a job, be a parent, and contribute to society\u2014 all while living well in a small, low-impact space. The project also hopes to spark interest in the way that fun and forward-thinking innovation can help address the challenges facing both current and future generations as our world becomes increasingly complex.\nWebsite\nhttp://www.dumpsterproject.org\nIndustry\nRenewables & Environment\nCompany size\n2-10 employees\nHeadquarters\nAustin, Texas\nType\nNonprofit\nSimilar pages\nDirty Dog Dumpster\nWaste Treatment and Disposal\nIndianapolis, IN\nDumpster USA\nEnvironmental Services\nWest Babylon, New York\nSame Day Dumpster Rental\nConsumer Services\nBurr Ridge, Illinois\nDumpster Market\nConsumer Services\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nShow more similar pages\nBrowse jobs\nAndroid Developer jobs\n41,511 open jobs\nEngineer jobs\n608,159 open jobs\nSign in to see who you already know at Dumpster Project\nSign in\nor\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn\u2019s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.\nContinue with Google\nNew to LinkedIn?

When you hear this, your mind might automatically visualise a homeless man, or so I assume. But this is not the case, Jeff chose to live in a dumpster to escape his conventional, consumerist and comfortable lifestyle.\nAccording to the Washington Post, before his dumpster days, he was living in a comfortable, 3,000 square-foot home in Texas, with a walk-in closet, a grand and accessible bathroom and a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. He worked as a professor at a state university, he commuted one hour to work everyday and had \"a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\"\nAnd now, he has none of those things and has never been happier! So what changed?\nHe received a new job as an associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson Univsersity in Austin, and lived in a dumpster on the college campus for a year until he vacated last month.\n\u201cAS A WAY OF HAVING A BETTER LIFE, I DECIDED TO MOVE INTO A DUMPSTER.\u201d\n- JEFF WILSON TOLD THE POST\nHe decks out the dumpster pretty well, complete with air-conditioning, a mailbox and false-floor storage space. The challenge was done to prove that people don't need a big home packed with endless possessions to be happy, and they exist!\nThe immediate benefits were obvious to Wilson, they included lower rent, lower utility payments, less time spent doing chores, shorter commute (90 seconds on foot) and less money spent on unnecessary possessions.\nBecause of his much smaller living space, Wilson told the post that he spent a lot less time at home. Instead, he hung around on campus ACTUALLY speaking to people and interacting with other human beings.\nAccording to the Washington Post, \"There are all these studies that say the broader and deeper your social network is, not only does it create more happiness, but it increases your life span,\" Wilson said. \"In the modern home you can have a cradle to grave experience. Your doula can pop you out in the living room, you can get an MIT education online, order food from outside and then work from home until you die in the living room watching your flat screen TV.\"\nWilson had to give up almost all of his possessions. Among the few possessions he purchased while living in the dumpster were a garden gnome and a small air conditioning unit, as the dumpster reached scorching hot levels inside.\nFrom his dumpster experiment Wilson also learnt the detriment of noise, and how it keeps us from looking for a meaningful life.\n\"You can't be aware enough to watch for meaning if you're buried in e-mails or facing a barrage of direct messages on Twitter,\" he told The Post. \"You don't have the bandwidth or the time or the attention to watch. You're looking, but watching is a different exercise.\"\nThe dumpster project allows all of us to really think about the stuff we own and what we rely on, or what we THINK we need. If we take a leaf from Professor Dumpster's book then we can see just how little we need to be happy, and that human interaction and experiences are what create purpose... not things.\nImages credited to Sarah Natsumi More and Jeff Wilson\nDid you like this post?\nThen join us in taking practical climate action to live better for us and for the planet.\nJoin 1 Million Women\nCARBON\nCHALLENGE\n704,728,747,935\nTONNES OF CO2\nSAVINGS PLEDGED\nCan you cut 1 Tonne of carbon pollution out of your life?\nTake the challenge\nSUBSCRIBE TO\nOUR NEWSLETTER\nTo get a notification when new blog articles come out\nSubscribe\nSHEA HOGARTH\nFORMER INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT\nSUGGEST AN ARTICLE SEND US AN EMAIL\nPOPULAR BLOG ARTICLES\nWeaving a home...how one woman can help millions of people globally\n19th Aug 2015\n8 Single-Use Items to Ditch From Your Life\n18th Feb 2015\nThis alien-like creature will break your heart when you find out what it really is...\n18th Mar 2015\nCONTACT US\nPRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS OF USE\n\u00a9 COPYRIGHT 1 MILLION WOMEN\n ",

He and his helpers have done a lot of work on his home for the last year, and now it must be said: He's going to miss that trash container. He confessed he teared up Tuesday night, his last in the dumpster.\n\"The last few nights have been really sweet,\" he said at the end of last week in the dumpster, which has a window air-conditioning unit, storage under a false floor, a sliding roof with a weather station that takes measurements every five minutes, and not much else.\n\"Identitywise, am I still Professor Dumpster if I'm not living in a dumpster? I don't know if this is what my mom wanted for her first-born son,\" Wilson said.\nThe Dumpster Project, led by Wilson, has focused not only on sustainability and education outreach, but also the challenges and opportunities born out of living in a used \u2014 albeit thoroughly scrubbed and fumigated \u2014 36-square-foot trash bin that's been on campus and around town. After an initial phase of what was little more than camping in a dumpster, the place now has a few comforts, including a small electric heater and art on the walls. He painted the interior a sort of eggshell color to give the illusion of more space.\n\"The hypothesis we started with was that one can have a pretty good life in and on a lot less,\" Wilson told the Austin American-Statesman (http://atxne.ws/1KhX9bU ). \"Stuff is noise.\"\nWilson evicted himself at a reception on campus Wednesday afternoon, and the plan now is for the dumpster to become more of a hub for education. The Dumpster Project \"Home\" School will have curriculum on sustainability. Educators will be staying in the dumpster, according to Amanda Masino, who also teaches biology at Huston-Tillotson, and students will be given a \"semiridiculous challenge: Turn the dumpster into a house. What happens when you don't have constant temperature? Where do you get water? How do you treat it?\"\n\"It's better doing it like this than talking about it in a dry way,\" Masino said.\nWilson figures he spent maybe 250 nights in the can. Other nights he was traveling, with his daughter or staying with his girlfriend.\n\"Usually when it was my place or hers, the answer was pretty definite,\" he said.\nWhen he wasn't there, it was usually occupied by students or visitors drawn to his goofy stunt with a serious purpose.\n\"It pushes your limits,\" he said. \"It totally blew up the idea of what a home is. In this climate, having central air and heat is more necessary than having a kitchen. But it would have been nice to have a toilet. The main complaint from students was a weak Wi-Fi signal \u2014 allegedly to do their homework.\"\n\"My dream,\" he said, \"is to get Google Fiber in the dumpster.\"\nAlthough he'll always be attached to the Dumpster Project, Wilson is turning to a new endeavor: spending 99 nights in a variety of homes all over Austin, whether it be at new City Council Member Greg Casar's place, a nursing home, a shotgun house on the east side, a McMansion to the west, a spot in the clouds at the Austonian and even \u2014 OK, it's an outside shot \u2014 the Governor's Mansion.\nThe new project, called 99 Nights ATX, will continue his exploration of the contemporary notion of house and home in Austin, in conventional and unconventional spaces \u2014 not to mention determine where he's going to live next. It helps that he has just a handful of shirts and a few pairs of shoes \u2014 enough to fit in a bag as he schleps around town, usually on his bike.\n\"We want a comprehensive view of the stories people tell themselves about home,\" he said. \"Housing is probably the biggest issue in Austin.\"\nThe project's website is taking nominations for housing outside of Wilson's circle of friends and associates.\nIt'll for sure be another adventure, but it'll be hard to top the dumpster.\n\"I've lived in 23 places in my life,\" Wilson said. \"This is the smallest. I know my community and my environment better. I got to know my neighbors.\"\nOne thing that may or may not change is the signoff on his email:\n\"At your disposal, Jeff.\"\n\"I may or may not keep that, but I will be litter-ally at people's disposal,\" he said.\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nAd\nLearn More\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

There, click-clacking away at his hometown Starbucks, revising a journal article, an epiphany struck.\n\"I was looking out the window and was thinking, 'Man, do I just want to publish papers for the rest of my life?'\" the biological science professor reminisced. \"I saw a dumpster and thought, 'I'm going to move into a dumpster.'\"\nNearly a year later, and Wilson's lease was up. He posted an announcement on Facebook, alerting his friends he was selling everything in his apartment for one dollar. Within an hour, all he had left was a suitcase.\nWilson started secretly sleeping on the floor of his office at the University of Texas at Brownsville before deciding to take a position at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Luckily, the administration approved of his unconventional lifestyle, and agreed to make his Dumpster Project an official course.\n\"This has always been a sustainability-focused project,\" Wilson said.\nYet, it's swiftly evolved into much more. Or rather, \"much less.\"\nWilson still drives a Volvo and is the father of a six-year-old daughter. He still frequents all the same \"hipster bars\" in East Austin and partakes in the craziest OkCupid dates ever.\n\"All is the same except, sidenote: I'm living in a dumpster.\"\nRather than a sole environmental experiment, the project now has a living-on-less spin, with an added K-12 educational component. Come the spring semester, Wilson will adopt the moniker, \"Professor Dumpster,\" and will bring his student-selected, 33-square-foot home to various schools. The goal is to spark curiosity and conversation around, say, the items one would need to live in a dumpster.\nWilson, who's currently couch surfing, lives on one backpack of clothes, which he's able to rattle off in precise detail.\n\"I've got a pair of orange pants, a pair of khakis \u2014 non-wrinkle \u2014 purple pants and black Levis,\" Wilson said, later adding on four shirts, a down jacket and one sport coat. \"For the formal stuff. I'm also a dean at this school.\"\nOne would find underwear and socks scattered throughout his luggage, as well. While, on his feet, Wilson would be donning Black Chuck Taylors, or black or brown wingtip boots.\nThe Dumpster Project will officially kick off when classes start mid-January. Wilson will have his students help him pick up the donated dumpster and run an analysis on the bugs living inside. From there, they will clean it up and he will move on in with his sponsored camping gear.\nAs the semester goes on, the class will begin experimenting on ways to make the dumpster more livable. How does one make a toilet? What's the best method for taking a towel bath when it's only 40 degrees outside? Wilson will try it, \"as long as [he] can stand it.\" And when he can't, he will bring in the Dumpster Team.\n\"I don't need a lot of help from Harvard-educated architects to set up a sleeping bag in a dumpster,\" Wilson \u2014 who completed postdoctoral work at Harvard himself \u2014 admitted. He will, however, need help properly fitting his amenities, such as a traditional toilet, heater and air conditioner, sustainably into the crowded space as the months go on.\nDr. Rich Corsi of the University of Texas at Austin has already started analyzing what the air quality of an eight-cubic-meter space would be with a person living 365 days a year in it, according to Wilson.\nThe goal is to try and have someone living in the dumpster every day. When Wilson wants to go see his daughter or needs a little break, he would like to have a volunteer move in.\n\"I have convinced the provost to come stay,\" Wilson said.\nHis \"Martha Stewart-type\" mother, however, is bound to be staying away. Wilson acknowledged she is the most resistant to the project. Although his ex-wife was the last to know, she agreed to be fine with it, as long as the pair's daughter didn't spend any nights in Wilson's humble new home.\n\"I don't want to consider this a stunt,\" Wilson said. \"This is a project. \u2026 Maybe they still think it's a hipster living in a trash can, but I see it more as an experiment.\"\nRECOMMENDED\nStay ahead of who & what is next\nJoin other professionals leveraging local news and actionable insights\nSign up\nShare the Beat\nBack to Top\nBOSTINNO\nStories\nEvents\nNewsletter\nSubmit a Nomination\nContact Us\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nSite Map\nCookie Settings\n\u00a9 2024 American City Business Journals.

As people continue to scale down, living more simplistic, minimalist lives, many report feeling happier. To determine just how little a person could live happily and comfortable on, Wilson is conducting an experiment to see how small he can go; and he\u2019s doing it in a repurposed dumpster.\nFor one year Wilson will live in a 33 square ft dumpster, transforming the \u201chome\u201d from its bare bones to a high-tech., sustainable living quarter along the way, all while monitoring the minimum needed to survive and thrive. For the first few months of The Dumpster Project, Wilson was sleeping inside the dumpster on cardboard boxes. He has since upgraded to a bed, minimal storage and even air conditioning. He still fetches water but will soon be connecting a shower and toilet to the dumpster through the outside.\nWilson poses these thought-provoking questions to his class: What does home look like in a world of 10 billion people? How do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices? Can the world\u2019s finite resources actually sustain the swelling population?\nWilson will enter the project\u2019s third phase in a few months, the phase he calls the \u201cuber dumpster home.\u201d That\u2019s where the dumpster will be retrofitted with solar panels, go completely off the electric grid and obtain that coveted curb appeal\u2013 by making it look less like a dumpster.\nProfessor Wilson told The Atlantic, \u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\nOn October 6-8 The Dumpster Project will be on display at SXSWECO.\nPhotos: Sarah Natsumi\n    This article originally appeared in truthAtlas, an online news source featuring multi-media stories about people and ideas making the world a better place.

Photo / Jeff Wilson\nLower rent, lower power bills, less time spent doing chores and a shorter commute among myriad benefits.\nJeff Wilson's life had all the trappings of a conventional adult existence.\nFor starters, he was living in a comfortable, 280sqm Texas, home with a large walk-in wardrobe, an easily accessible bathroom and a US$1600 (NZ$2181) monthly mortgage payment. He had a professorship at a state university, an hour-long commute and a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\nDO YOU HAVE A STORY TO SHARE WITH LIFE & STYLE? SEND US AN EMAIL\nToday, Wilson has none of those things - and insists that he's never been happier.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertise with NZME.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertise with NZME.\nBetween then and now, there was a divorce, a new job in a new city, a surrendering of worldly possessions, a new social arrangement with a new romantic partner and - perhaps most importantly - an olive green rubbish skip that he called home.\nUntil he vacated it last month to move in with his new girlfriend, Wilson - an associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin - spent an entire year living in a converted trash receptacle on the historically black college campus.\nOn its face, turning the 3sqm space into a livable home - complete with an air conditioner unit, weather station, mailbox, and a false-floor basement to store cooking equipment and clothes - was a bold exercise in sustainability that demonstrated a person's ability to comfortably exist in a space 1 per cent the size of the average American household.\n\"It's an insane idea on the surface, and it may be an insane idea below the surface,\" he told the Washington Post.\nWilson said the immediate benefits of living in the container were myriad: Lower rent, lower utility payments, less time spent doing chores, a shorter commute (approximately 90 seconds on foot) and less money spent on unnecessary possessions. Those benefits may sound underwhelming compared to the sacrifice involved, but in totality, Wilson said, they offered a new freedom.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertise with NZME.\nBecause his living space was so small, Wilson said he also spent much less time at home.\nInstead, he was frequently on and around campus, having face-to-face interactions. (Importantly, he also had to leave the skip to use the toilet or take showers, which he did at the campus gymnasium.)\nWilson made the dumpster feel like home. Photo / Jeff Wilson\nHe was forced to give away almost everything he owned, he said. At his most spartan, he owned four pants, four shirts (two short-sleeve and two long-sleeve), three pairs of shoes, three hats and eight or nine bowties, according to the SpareFoot Blog.\nAmong the few possessions he did purchase were a garden gnome and a small AC unit to offset the blazing summer heat, which reached as high as 54C.\nDiscover more\nNEW ZEALAND\nThe truth about house prices\n18 Jul 04:02 AM\nLIFESTYLE\nThe invisible man\n25 Oct 05:00 AM\nENTERTAINMENT\nBlock duo's secret paradise\n26 Oct 12:00 AM\nLIFESTYLE\n10 ways to cut your food bill\n10 Nov 04:45 AM\nBut as \"Professor Dumpster\" (as he is now known) readjusts to a more demanding lifestyle, he has come to realise that the last year was also an experiment in reducing \"noise.\"\nNot necessarily the audible kind, he said, but the kind of noise that arrives in the form of endless e-mails and informational overload that has spawned the \"digital detox\" movement.\nFor now, the skip will remain on campus as an educational tool for students, artists and educators, who can tour the home or spend a few nights inside.\nJoin the conversation of the Herald Life Facebook page\nLatest from Lifestyle\nPREMIUM\nLIFESTYLE\nA dog's life: The new DNA technology that could significantly extend your pet's longevity\n27 Aug 09:20 AM\nNEW ZEALAND\nReview: Mark Wahlberg's The Union 'a bit silly' but also a load of fun\n27 Aug 09:00 AM\nLIFESTYLE\n'Every day': Kiwis divided in daily shower debate\n27 Aug 08:12 AM\nHow back to nature benefits business\nSPONSORED\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertise with NZME.\nRecommended for you\nRefresh for more\nTENNIS\nUS Open: Lulu Sun retires hurt from first round match\nKAHU\nFintech aims to break down banking barriers\nENTERTAINMENT\nNick Cave's heartbreaking mental health confession\nBUSINESS\n'NZ's biggest Asian supermarket' opening at Westgate\nWORLD\n'Unrecognisable': Sudan dam burst destroys villages\npaid promoted content\nRecommended by\nPROMOTED\nChinese surveillance plane breaches Japanese airspace for first time\nNikkei Asia\nPROMOTED\nElectrician reveals: 1 simple tip to slash your electricity bill by up to 90%\nSmart Energy\nPROMOTED\nOn topic: Who is Thailand's youngest-ever PM, Paetongtarn Shinawatra?\nNikkei Asia\nPROMOTED\nGlaucoma and cataract can disappear!

Reduce, reuse, recycle. I use metal water bottles over and over again; I reuse my kitchen trash in the compost bin in my garden; and I make my own paper with scrap paper from the mailbox and other waste that would generally go into the landfill.\nThe story I\u2019m about to tell you, frankly, is something I would not try, but this is one man\u2019s experiment into the darkest depths of cutting back.\nBelow is a photo of a dumpster. We\u2019ve all seen them. But, can you imagine living in one? (Not only no, but h\u2014 no, was my initial response). Read on.\nA college professor named Jeff Wilson lived in a dumpster for a year. It was located on the campus of the Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, where he teaches.\nWilson, an environmental studies professor, wanted to prove one could live happily and in health in a very small space. After all, millions of people around the world live in a lot less space than we are used to. So he set about finding a new home in a dumpster. The dumpster he chose had 33 square feet of living space. The average American home has about 2,500 square feet.\nHaving lots of collections from the many countries I have visited, and a collection of Venetian and Czech glass, I find it difficult to imagine living in 33 square feet. But Wilson managed to do it in comfort for a year. He had an air conditioner, a shower, toilet, kitchen, wi-fi and even solar power.\nThe professor said he wanted to be the ultimate \u201cone-percenter.\u201d His goal was to create only 1 percent of the waste that is created in the average home, and use 1 percent of the energy and water we all do.\n\u201cProfessor Dumpster,\u201d as he was lovingly called, spent his days teaching environmental science, and in the dumpster, he was testing sustainable technologies and low-waste living.\nStudents had a lot to say about him living in a trash bin, including the possibility of homeless people finding shelter in a trash-can village. They began to think in terms of a minimalist. They donated time and skills to the project, and cut out things like cars, which cause pollution, and in some students\u2019 minds were completely unnecessary. Everything they needed was within walking distance of the university. The Dumpster Project began giving tours of dumpster homes to encourage more people to take the plunge into dumpster living.\nThe question for the future is: How can we equip upcoming generations with the tools they need to have a sustainable lifestyle? One answer is with a 33-square-foot dumpster and a team of dumpster experts to transform a trash container into a sustainable house.\nI wonder how many people could actually do this, unless it were necessary?\nDr. Karen Magid, known as Doctor Basura (\u201ctrash\u201d in Spanish), is the project manager for the dumpster project at the university. Dr. Amanda Masino, aka The Dirt-y Professor, is the head of the Green is the New Black student group and an assistant professor of biology. She also works on the dumpster project. She is working on a dumpster science lab.\nDr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, lived in the dumpster for a year, proving it is possible to be happy and healthy in less space.\nOK, readers \u2026 who\u2019s going to try this next? If this isn\u2019t for you, you might like to nominate your favorite teacher. The Dumpster Project is currently taking nominations.\n    Dianne Erskine-Hellrigel is executive director of the Community Hiking Club and president of the Santa Clara River Watershed Conservancy.

When we had a guinea pig, I used the shreds from our paper shredder to line the bottom of the cage. (Green and saves $$) The round cardboard circle behind the frozen pizzas can be wrapped in foil and reused as a cake platter. The cardboard mushroom boxes can be reused in SO many ways! Misprints from your printer can be reused as note paper. I usually cut stacks in half and staple them. Plastic produce bags have many uses including doggy poop bags. I wash out plastic butter tubs/Cool Whip containers and reuse. The tops of these containers can be used for arts and crafts: holding glue or glitter, etc. Many of the `to go\u2019 containers from fast food restaurants can be washed and reused. I wash out the plastic Starbucks cups and reuse many times. I have saved large oatmeal containers and coffee cans and donated them to my local kindergarten class to use for art projects. :)\nReply\nT. Jones says:\nMonday, Mar 2, 2015 at\nI do all the things Michele Klein Feldman does and more. Reduce and reuse is the key. Very little of what we \u201crecycle\u201d is actually recycled. Most still end up in landfills\u2013sorry to tell the truth or better yet, get you searching for it. However, I\u2019ve never understood these demonstrations of silliness by\u2026living in a dumpster, kids sleeping in a cardboard box, celebrities eating beans and rice et, al. We need real solutions. Not feel-goodism. Living in a dumpster was like camping or a tree house for this guy. He\u2019s young, idealistic and now seemingly celebrated by those who think this is a viable idea. It\u2019s not. Micro house movement-yes, living in a dumpster-no.\nReply\nT. Jones says:\nMonday, Mar 2, 2015 at\nFurthermore, I think the idea of sympathizing with the homeless by living in a dumpster is insulting. Really\u2026I have to live in a dumpster to \u201cunderstand\u201d how much it sucks? Whats\u2019s next do I have to have cancer to understand how much that sucks too. Sorry, I don\u2019t think so!\nReply\nTessa Lucero says:\nTuesday, Mar 3, 2015 at\nI\u2019m all for reduce, reuse, recycle, especially reducing consumption since reusing requires space to keep things you intend to reuse and recycling consumes resources even if the items do get recycled. However, living in a dumpster seems a bit extreme. How much did it cost in time, money, and materials to outfit that dumpster to become living space? How energy-efficient is an uninsulated dumpster? And what happens when the first Texas-sized tornado comes along?\nReply\nLeave a Comment\nName (required):\nEmail (required):\nWebsite:\n\nOPINION SECTION POLICY\nAll opinions and ideas are welcome.

So seriously that he\u2019s planning on ditching the dive and actually living in a dumpster for an entire year. This won\u2019t be your typical trash-muck-encrusted dumpster, though; \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d and his students will be designing their own 33-square-foot dumpster outfitted with a bed, shower, toilet, and even WiFi. Wilson\u2019s living space will double as a classroom \u2014 his students will then work on making the teensy residence as energy efficient and low-impact as possible. \u201cI\u2019m essentially becoming part of the 1%. This dumpster is 33 square feet, which is 1% the size of the new American home in 2011,\u201d Wilson joked. \u201cThe idea here is to ultimately show one can have a pretty good life in a dumpster.\u201d\nThis college professor is so sneaky it hurts. He\u2019s pretending he\u2019s making a grand statement about the environment by moving into a dumpster but he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing: Making his students build a bachelor pad for him under the disguise of \u201ccollege\u201d. Sounds like a dream come true for me. Everything I need in a 33 square foot apartment. I don\u2019t need a dining room table or a place for people to put their shoes. I need the internet, a microwave, a tv, and a chair to watch the tv. Professor Sneaky over here is even throwing in a shower out of pure arrogance. Calling it a dumpster when it\u2019s clearly not even close to a dumpster in order to pretend he cares about saving the whales. In reality he just wants a place to stroke his dick and not pay any bills.\nREAD MORE\n\nNate\n10/18/2013 2:44 AM\n0\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

And, he\u2019s offering them for free to anyone who will provide the land for rent (in exchange for splitting the rental income).\nThe Jupe units are fully off-grid and designed to ship flat-packed, enabling bulk deliveries of fifteen units on a single truck. \u201cArriving with all the essentials \u2018in the box\u2019\u2014including a luxury queen mattress and bed, furniture, LED lighting, solar panels and backup batteries, and even the linens\u2014Jupes assemble in a little over an hour and units are ready to rent the day they arrive,\u201d explains Wilson.\nDespite its canvas cladding Wilson calls it \u201cmore a device than a tent: Jupe\u2019s units are built on an innovative \u201cchassis\u201d foundation that gives them the flexibility to move quickly and freely, adapt to any terrain, and oftentimes forgo the necessity of building permits.\u201d This exoskeleton for housing allows for rapid assembly, and disassembly, requiring no foundation work, no platform, and no electrical utility drags, so \u201cpermits are rarely necessary\u201d.\nWilson says it wouldn\u2019t be hard to add SIPP panels or more conventional walls to make these adequate for longer-term living; currently they are ideal for not only short-term rentals, but as popup disaster relief shelter.\nOn the \u201cSlow Coast\u201d of California (north of Santa Cruz), Dr. Wallace Nichols lost his home to the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fires and decided a big box of a house no longer makes sense and instead chose to purchase six Jupes for his 20-acre property that not only went up fast but could be moved fast in the event of another fire.\nJupe popup shelter tests Freemium for housing relief & stays.\nVideo on Kasita tiny prefab (Jeff\u2019s previous endeavor).\nEmailPocketInstapaperReddit\nRelated\nKasita: tiny prefab home-as-a-service for post-land urbanism\nJuly 24, 2016\nIn \"videos\"\nVipp Shelter tiny prefab as precise industrial-era appliance\nNovember 29, 2015\nIn \"videos\"\nModal is a backyard home to rent-out or dwell-in anywhere\nAugust 1, 2021\nIn \"videos\"\ntags: 1 hour prefab, affordable housing, agile housing, disaster housing, dumpster home, exoskeleton, exoskeleton housing, free upfront housing, high-tech shelter, instant housing, jeff wilson, jupe shelter, jupe village, kasita, kit of parts house, modular construction, modular housing, offgrid housing, plug and play solar, popup housing, prefab, prefab construction, professor dumpster, rapid deploy housing, relief housing, short-stay-as-service, slow coast, ssaas, village of jupe units\ndocumentaries\nbiokabin\ngotham micro-flats\n(un)housed\nwhat is \u201chome\u201d?\npandemic-proof\ntiny houses\npre-vanlife\nlean urbanism\ncategories\narticles\nvideos\nabout\n*faircompanies\nterms\nnicol\u00e1s boullosa\nkirsten dirksen\ncontact\nmedia kit\nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (cc) | *faircompanies, since 2007",

(Photo: Jon Swartz, for USA TODAY)\nAuthor: Jon Swartz (USA TODAY , WUSA)\nPublished: 8:32 PM CDT March 19, 2017\nUpdated: 8:32 PM CDT March 19, 2017\n\"Professor Dumpster\" had just led a tour of his 352-square-foot house when the inevitable question arose: Who would be willing to plunk down $139,000 for a state-of-the-art home that small?\nJeff Wilson, a former environmental science professor who gained that moniker after living a year in a 33-square-foot dumpster here, launches into an impassioned spiel.\n\"We've been doing housing wrong for decades,\" says Wilson, who first turned his dumpster into a sustainable home in early 2014. \"We are in a housing catastrophe... the Sears home catalog was the last big innovation\" more than a century ago.\nAfter his residency in a literal dump, Wilson started Kasita (casita means \"tiny house\" in Spanish), a designer of mobile, modular homes that are stackable. The pre-fabricated homes can be constructed in three weeks \u2014 and could go a long way toward easing the affordable housing crunch that has bedeviled much of the country.\n\nWith the help of former employees at Google, Elon Musk's SolarCity and Bell Helicopter, Wilson thinks he has a solution to provide homes and stackable apartments in unused pieces of land such as vacant parking lots. \"If you file for a backyard unit, it can be approved in weeks,\" says Wilson, who predicts his homes could hit the market this summer.\n\"We need to find cracks in the system rather than take a sledgehammer to it,\" he says.\nIf the reaction of consumers at Kasita's recent party at SXSW is any indication, interest is high. Hundreds patiently waited in line to get a peek at the modular home, which features a bathroom/shower, kitchen, bedroom and living room patio.\nA remote control allows dwellers to quickly change mood lighting and an entertainment system. Date mode finds Marvin Gaye's smooth voice filling the small living area. Storage space is built into steps, walls and other nooks and crannies.\nThe 21-person start-up, based here, is not only espousing the mantra that small is beautiful, but it can be environmental and profitable. Wilson says several mayors are interested in the homes, and he intends to visit California to make his pitch this month.\n\"Green is the new black,\" Wilson says.\nClose Ad\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nPlay this game for 1 minute and see why everyone is addicted.\nPlay this game for free.

After all, dating a guy who lives in a refurbished dumpster isn't for everyone.\nSure enough, his new paramour was cool with it, and Wilson, a professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Texas, says it was at that moment that he realized they were \"meant to be.\"\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"She has stayed in there a few nights with me,\" he said, referring to his dumpster, during a HuffPost Live interview Thursday.\nWilson said that his \"alternative housing situation\" actually helps their dating life because it forces them to engage in stimulating activities outside.\n\"I feel like we actually spend more time together now,\" he explained. \"Obviously we don't spend much time at my place, but we actually don't spend that much time at her place, either. We find ourselves roaming around the city more, interacting with others on campus more, others in various parts of town. We made a local hotel our living room, in some sense. We spend more time at our friends' houses. I would say in most ways it's effective in a more positive way.\"\nHe added that scouring for activities outside the home has strengthened his and his girlfriend's relationship.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"The way that the average American home is built these days, you can really do anything from birth to death inside your home. ... You could literally never leave,\" Wilson said. \"When you have a smaller living space like this -- much radically smaller -- you tend to spend more time outdoors and out in the community together than you would, and I'd say that's had a really positive effect on our relationship.\"\nCheck out Wilson's dumpster home for yourself in the full HuffPost Live conversation here.\nSign up here for Live Today, HuffPost Live's new morning email that will let you know the newsmakers, celebrities and politicians joining us that day and give you the best clips from the day before!\nRELATED\nVIDEO\nHPL\nMINIMALIST LIVING\nTHIRD METRIC\nGO TO HOMEPAGE\nLEAVE A COMMENT\nSuggest a correction\n|\nSubmit a tip\nFROM OUR PARTNER\nThe downfall of Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's 'Iron Lady'\nNikkei Asia | Paid\nUS Citizen Abroad?

He's moved out from the dumpster, yes, the dumpster, he called home for one full year on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas.\n\nHe's an Environmental Studies professor who he says he wanted to prove you can be happy and healthy in a very small space the way millions of people live around the world. Very small is an understatement try 33 square feet compared with the almost 2,500 square feet of the average American home.\n\nIn reality, it was sometimes less than ideal. He did have some amenities though, like a mailbox, air conditioner, and eventually solar power.\n\nWilson says he wants to be the ultimate one-percenter: Create only one percent of the waste of the average home, and use one percent of the energy and water.\n\n\n\nMore on AOL:\nWhy you should always be kind to strangers on public transit\nThe most wonderfully awkward moments on the Oscars red carpet\n89-year-old grandpa surprises Tinder dates, and their reactions are amazing\nShow comments\nIn Other News\nEntertainment\nPeople\nJessica Simpson sizzles in second-skin catsuit, big hair and even bigger hoops: See h\u2026\nThe Today Show\n'Officially an empty nester': Brooke Shields cries after dropping off daughters at co\u2026\nFinance\nFortune\nRed Lobster\u2019s new leader is a millennial Wall Street fave who doesn\u2019t believe in work\u2026\nCBS News\nCompany failed to protect workers who now need lung transplants, feds say\nFood\nCheapism\n25 dishes and drinks named after famous people\nGood Morning America\nUS Open recipes to serve signature cocktails, chef-inspired dishes at home\nLighter Side\nFox News\nTwo West Virginia fishing buddies break state records within hours of each other\nSports\nUSA TODAY\nNFL roster cuts 2024: Live updates on notable moves ahead of Tuesday's deadline\nAssociated Press\nCoco Gauff begins her US Open title defense with an easy win after a two-match losing\u2026\nWeather\nReuters\nBrazil sugar producers report impact from fires in Sao Paulo state\nAssociated Press\nIn a rare event, fire smoke covers Brazil's capital, prompting federal response\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nRelated articles\nShow comments\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nRelated articles\nShow comments\nFeedback\nHelp\nJoin AOL\nAccessibility\nEU Digital Services Act\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard\nAbout Us\nAbout Our Ads\nAdvertising\nSitemap\n\u00a9 2024 Yahoo.

Wilson\u2019s not \u201call talk\u201d, either, and will spend the next year of his life living in a standard 6\u2019x6\u2032 commercial dumpster to prove his point.\nThis dumpster, to be specific \u2026\nMy Latest Videos\n\u2026 which, yeah. That\u2019s a dumpster.\nCalling him \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d, the Dumpster Project website is chronicling Wilson\u2019s year in the dumps- which began back in February- and using his experience as a basis for a video documentary that will, presumably, debut at SXSW next year. Accoring to the site, Wilson \u201cwill be spending one year in a dumpster that is approximately 6 feet x 6 feet, or about 1% the size of the average new American home. Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the \u2018new 1%\u2019 will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home.\u201d\nFor the moment, the dumpster is just that- a 6\u00d76 foot dumpster that\u2019s been cleaned out, painted, and hooked up to the grid. Wilson, however, has bigger plans for his 1% home. If \u201cphase 1\u201d is the dumpster, itself, \u201cphase 2\u201d adds a shade structure to minimize his need for the \u201cwindow\u201d mounted AC unit, as well as a laundry unit/bathroom built into a tool shed next to the unit \u2026\n\u2026 now, if you\u2019re anything like me, you noticed that Wilson seems to be saying that he wants to take up quite a bit more than the \u201c1% of a new home\u201d he originally talked about, but he\u2019s still committed to using a small % of a new home\u2019s footprint while staying at that 1% level of resources. He plans to do that by building up, rather than out \u2026\n\u2026 Wilson\u2019s forward-looking plans would stack dumpsters, Lego-style, and use their opened \u201clids\u201d as perfectly placed solar \u201cleaves\u201d, each of which would hold a solar PV panel of its own that would allow Professor Dumpster to separate fully from the grid, and even teach his classes outside.\nYou can check out Wilson\u2019s \u201cpitch\u201d for the project in a short video, below, and let us know what you think of Wilson\u2019s extreme tiny house experiment- and whether or not you think you could be happy in a 6\u00d76\u2032 footprint!- in the comments section at the bottom of the page.

It was, he says, \"a radical experiment in what it would mean to live on, and in, less\" - specifically, 33 square feet. He moved out in February, but the experiment continues.\nNine educators since have taken up residency for up to a week to see what it's like to live without running water. Cooking is on a camping stove. But there is electricity. To battle interior heat that rises to over 130 degrees in Texas' sweltering summers, the bin had to be connecting to the grid so air conditioning could be installed. There's now a TV and an overhead light. But it's still tight quarters.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\n\"There were a few who grabbed the spirit early on, like they were camping,\" says Amanda M. Masino, a biology professor and co-director of the Dumpster Project. \"And then there were some that brought two pieces of luggage and realized they didn't have room to open it in here.\"\nTeachers are welcome for sleepovers. And Masino has developed a curriculum in which students design workable tech for the space - such as using sheep wool, more environmentally friendly than fiberglass, as insulation. Elementary students might build water filters; college students design solar-powered installations. More than 1,400 have visited the container, which also travels to science and art exhibits across the state to share its sustainability message.\nAs for Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, he had his dislikes (school gym as bathroom) and likes (mobility, scaled-down possessions). He has left Huston-Tillotson to funnel the lessons learned into an urban living experiment: prefab apartments of only 225 square feet (seven times the size of his previous residence) that fit onto a rack and can be transported. Each rack holds four units. Austin gets the first rack in April (rent: about $600 a month before slotting fees), with other cities to follow.\n\"Even at the extreme end of the spectrum,\" Wilson concludes, \"a lot less can bring a lot more to your life.\"\nHouston Chronicle Logo\nSign up for The 713\nStart your day and stay informed with essential Houston news.\nEmail\nSign Up\nBy signing up, you agree to our Terms Of Use and acknowledge that your information will be used as described in our Privacy Policy.\nFeb 6, 2016\nNicholas St. Fleur\nMost Popular\n1.\nGeto Boys member and Houston rapper Scarface is in the ICU\n2.\nRice University police investigating apparent murder-suicide on campus\n3.\nFellow musicians share support for Houston rapper Scarface after hospitalization\n4.\nChris Stapleton and Miranda Lambert bring star power to Houston\n5.\nScarface: A short history of an ailing Houston music legend\nLatest Local News\nRice University police investigating apparent murder-suicide on campus\nHISD recruits for school nurses as school year begins\nHarris County Jail inmate dies two days after being hospitalized\nMosquito-borne EEE virus found in Houston County.

Each home is 352 square feet, stackable and costs $139,000. They\u2019re well suited for people who love to travel and like to spend time outside and out and about instead of cooped up in their homes.\nOriginally, Kasita was exploring the ability to allow each little home to move from city to city by hauling them on a truck and plugging them into a unit of Kasitas. Potential customers were more interested in elevating the technology within the homes and then simply moving their small amount of belongings from home to home if they so choose, Curbed explains.\nThere\u2019s so much to see and learn about these incredible little Kasitas.

Wilson\u2014who earned his doctorate at Harvard\u2014has taken the extreme measure to demonstrate the need for people to adopt more sustainable lifestyles or run the risk of using up the Earth\u2019s resources.\nIn its letter, PETA points out that prestigious institutions\u2014including the United Nations and the Stockholm International Water Institute\u2014have determined that a shift to a plant-based diet is vital for everything from slowing climate change to feeding the world\u2019s growing population. As an example, cattle consume 17 times more calories in grain than they produce as meat.\n\u201cWith so many delicious and Earth-friendly meat-, dairy-, and egg-free foods available, no one has to live in a dumpster to help save the planet,\u201d says PETA Special Projects Manager Alicia Woempner. \u201cAnd because meat-eaters are more prone to life-threatening conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, Dr. Wilson can help ensure his own sustainability simply by going vegan.\u201d\nFor more information, please visit PETA.org.\n  PETA\u2019s letter to Dr. Jeff Wilson follows.\n  February 10, 2014\n  Dr. Jeff Wilson\nExecutive Director\nThe Dumpster Project\n  Dear Dr. Wilson:\nI\u2019m writing on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and our more than 3 million members and supporters, including thousands across Texas. As an organization that works hard to raise awareness of the devastating impact of the animal-agriculture industry on our environment, we applaud your efforts to promote sustainable living. I\u2019d also like to urge you to go vegan and encourage your students to do the same, since cutting out resource-intensive meat, egg, and dairy foods is the best thing that we can all do to protect the planet and animals.\nRaising and killing animals for food is simply unsustainable. The United Nations has stated that a global shift to a vegan diet is vital in order to combat the worst effects of climate change, and the Stockholm International Water Institute warns that transitioning to a plant-based diet is the only way to feed the world\u2019s growing population. Eating meat wastes valuable resources. It takes up to 13 pounds of grain and 2,500 gallons of water to produce just a pound of meat. And it takes 18 times more land to produce 1 pound of chicken than it does to produce 1 pound of high-protein, cholesterol-free vegan \u201cchicken.\u201d\nIn addition to trashing the planet, the meat, dairy, and egg industries cause untold amounts of animal suffering. Chickens, for example, are crammed into filthy, ammonia-filled sheds for the majority of their short lives before they are packed into trucks for transport through all weather extremes to slaughter, during which they have their throats cut while they\u2019re still conscious and are often scalded to death in defeathering tanks.\nAll of us can help the environment without giving up our comfortable homes or favorite foods, simply by going vegan. Major grocery stores are stocked with delicious vegan foods\u2014from meat-free sausages to plant-based milks made from almonds, rice, or soy\u2014that can be stored safely, without any need for energy-intensive refrigeration.\nThank you for your consideration.\nSincerely,\nMarta Holmberg\nDirector of Youth Outreach\nFor Media: Contact PETA's Media Response Team.\nCONTACT\nGET PETA UPDATES\nFOLLOW US\nGET PETA UPDATES\nStay up to date on the latest vegan trends and get breaking animal rights news delivered straight to your inbox!\n\u201cAlmost all of us grew up eating meat, wearing leather, and going to circuses and zoos. We never considered the impact of these actions on the animals involved. For whatever reason, you are now asking the question: Why should animals have rights?\u201d\n\u2014 Ingrid E.

And then wrote this unnerving \u201cIt Happened To Me\u201d story for XOJane which included the detail that the dumpster was behind the women\u2019s dormitory at the university where he taught? (Seriously, were there no dumpsters behind the business school? Or the environmental studies program?)\nWell, Dumpster Dad is back, and he\u2019s now been promoted to Professor Dumpster. The Atlantic has a lengthy feature on Professor Dumpster (aka Jeff Wilson), one of those sweet glossy features with animated GIFs and dumpster schematics, and here are a few of the updates on Professor Dumpster\u2019s life:\n\u2014 People actually call Wilson \u201cProfessor Dumpster.\u201d I have no idea if this generated naturally or if it is Wilson\u2019s self-styled nickname (and BRAND). I do know that it is the name on Wilson\u2019s Instagram.\n\u2014 When we last heard from Wilson, he was ABD \u2014 All But Dumpster. Yes, when he first announced himself on the dumpster-living scene he wasn\u2019t actually living full-time in the dumpster! He was just camping there sometimes. Now he\u2019s apparently in the dumpster nearly every night, except for the nights he trades off with students from Green Is the New Black, an ecology group.\n\u2014 The dumpster is \u201csanctioned and supported\u201d by Huston-Tillotson University, the East Austin university at which Professor Dumpster both teaches and serves as Dean of the University College.\n\u2014 Professor Dumpster owns four pairs of pants, four shirts, and \u201ceight or nine\u201d bow ties.\n\u2014 The dumpster has air conditioning.\n\u2014 There is no mention of the woman that took up the last third of Wilson\u2019s XOJane piece, who \u2014 as a recap \u2014 met Wilson when he invited her on a blind date to explore Europe for 21 days and told her she couldn\u2019t pack anything.\n\u2014 There\u2019s no mention of Wilson\u2019s daughter, either. Has her mother relented and allowed her to spend overnights in the dumpster with daddy?\n\u2014 The dumpster is still \u201ctucked behind the women\u2019s residence halls.\u201d\nWhat do you think? Is the tiny house movement laudable, or is there something about this dumpster project that stinks? Take a minute to read the Atlantic profile, and then we can come back and discuss Professor Dumpster together.\nPhoto: Wayne Wilkinson (NOT a pic of Prof Dumpster\u2019s dumpster, please go to the Atlantic piece to see those pics)\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\nDistraction-free reading.

His goal is to live with 1% of what most Americans use in water, electricity, waste, and space.\nThe environmental science professor has already had to face flooding and temperatures reaching up to 124 degrees.\nWilson\u2019s biggest accomplishments so far include the first usable garden at the university in nearly 50 years, which is watered with condensation from a nearby AC unit, and a weather station that is attached to his dumpster.\nPhase two of this three step plan includes the addition of modern amenities, such as a hot water heater, a washing machine, and a dryer.\nProfessor Wilson\u2019s hopes his project will be an example for living a sustainable, albeit smelly, life.\n\u201cJust like Bill Nye the Science Guy or Mrs. Frizzle from the Magic School Bus, Professor Dumpster will engage with the next generation in creative thinking about the important topics of sustainability and science education,\u201d his website states.\nVia KENS.\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @samantha_reinis\nShare this article\nSamantha Reinis\nSouth Carolina Campus Correspondent\nView Profile\nFrom the Web\nPowered by ZergNet\nTim And Gwen Walz's Marriage Is Stranger Than We Ever Thought\nInappropriate Outfits Lauren Boebert Has Been Caught Wearing\nRumer Willis & Derek Richard Thomas Have Bad News\nWhat you stand for is what defines you\nConservative students on college campuses are marginalized, threatened, and silenced by threatening students who oppose their views, or radicalized leftist professors or administrators.

Featured recently over at Co.Exist, Prof. Dumpster (real name: Jeff Wilson), an environmental scientist over at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, plans to live in a souped up garbage can for a year, outfitting the 33-square-foot space with essentials like a shower, toilet, kitchen, and Wi-Fi. Over the course of the year, the professor\u2014a youngish guy with a goofy smile and thick-framed glasses\u2014aims to \"engage the next generation in creative thinking about the important topics of sustainability and science education,\" citing the likes of Bill Nye the Science Guy and Ms. Frizzle as influences.\nPer Co.Exist, Wilson came up with the idea while working on a paper in Starbucks: \"I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster.\" A year later he sold his belongings\u2014each item was $1\u2014and began living (clandestinely) in his office at the university. After seven months of that he bought and cleaned a used bin that, at 33-square-feet, measures just 1 percent the size of 2011's average new-built American home.\nFor the first phrase of the project, Wilson will be what he calls \"Dumpster camping,\" living in an empty shell, curled in a sleeping bag on the floor. Then he and his students will outfit the whole shebang in the types of modern conveniences that sap resources in regular homes: air conditioning, regular-bulb lighting, Xbox, and the like. It's all to establish a baseline for the final phase: an environmental impact makeover that brings in things like \"energy-producing\" toilets and nano-insulation to maintain temperature. (Yeah, OK, \"pimped out\" was the phrase Wilson used.) The plan is to travel around performing for kids in grades K through 12, even going into \"stealth mode\" and \"dropping it on a kids' playground and seeing what happens ... Because they're going to open the door and see an Xbox, a bed, a shower, all these things.\" More info, right this way.\n\u00b7 'Professor Dumpster' Is Moving Into A Garbage Can, And Bringing His Students With Him\n\u00b7 The Dumpster Project [official site]\n\u00b7 This tiny NYC abode is literally a Dumpster with a stove.

I recently retired from Albion College, where I taught courses about the brain, learning, and basic psychological principles.  I retain a lab at the College, where I examine both neural mechanisms of behavior and lawful changes in behavior in response to changes in the environment or experiences of the animal. My science also continues in my personal enterprise, Annelid Science (a room in my basement).\nHere is my vita. Here\u2019s an autobiography that I wrote around 2009. More recent update of the autobiography is here.\nI grew up in Pennsylvania, in a beautiful home that has since been converted to a bed and breakfast.  I attended Haverford College for my undergraduate education, and UCLA for my Ph.D.  I taught at Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Fort Wayne (now Purdue \u2013 Fort Wayne) for 15 years before coming to Albion in 1999.  I was an early member of Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience, giving the group its name and its logo, and I once served as its President.  I have been an officer of the Pavlovian Society  since 2002.\nI trace my scientific roots to Pavlov \u2014 I am his scientific great-grandson.  I did my Ph.D. with Stefan So\u0142tysik, who trained under Jerzy Konorski, who was Pavlov\u2019s first Polish student.  This might explain my deep interest in Pavlovian conditioning.   I have twice spent a semester at the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology in Warsaw, Konorski\u2019s institute.\nI was married twice; the first ended in divorce, the second with the death of my wife due to cancer. I have five great kids, including an architect, an aerospace engineer, an actor, and two in college. Three grandkids bring much joy when I get to see them.\nWhen I am not being academic, I enjoy interacting with my family, and occasionally trying to play the diatonic accordion (I have a Cajun 1-row and a 3-row on which I want to learn Tejano style).  Here are some examples of my Cajun accordion (another example,  a holiday offering,  my 1st public appearance, short Bach piece).  When I had time and money I enjoyed working on my 1939 Chevy (sadly, I sold it in 2019).\n         I have always been an avid photographer.  My best artistic photos, as well as photos of some local events, are now for sale at jeffwilson.zenfolio.com.  Before COVID I shot primarily rodeo and live music.  Recently I;ve merged my photography with a life-long interest in astronomy (I almost double-majored in physics and astronomy in college) \u2014 I\u2019m doing astrophotography.\nExcluding the well-known psychologists and neuroscientists with whom I have interacted, I have had \u201cbrushes with greatness\u201d that involve Katharine Hepburn, Francis Crick, Buckminster Fuller, and Stephen Jay Gould.\n  Contact information\nwjwilson@albion.edu\nwjwilson | August 12, 2010 1:16 am\nSubscribe\nEntries RSS | Comments RSS\nSearch\nPages\nAbout Me\nCourses\nHSP 123H \u2013 Neurophysiology for Beginners\nSome Nonparametric Statistics\nPsych 101\nPsych 204: Research Design & Analysis 1\nPsych 241 \u2013 Neuroscience 1\nNernst Equilibrium Potential\nPsych 245 \u2013 Learning\nSpring 2020 \u2013 Remaining Topics to be Covered\nWorking & Reference Memory\nPsych 348 \u2013 Research in Behavioral Neuroscience\nPSYCH 388 \u2013 Research in Invertebrate Behavior\nFree Software\nGrad School\nAttending the Society for Neuroscience Meeting\nResearch\nDSO Nano Pics\nResearch Opportunities\nUseful Links\nFUN photos\nLytro Photos\nLytroMe 3D pics\nMedia \u2013 temporary\nSiteMaster\nRegister\nLog in\nEntries feed\nComments feed\nWordPress.org\nJeff Wilson (he, him, his) is powered by WordPress\nWordPress Themes\nAuthors are solely responsible for the content and accuracy of their sites, including opinions they express,\nand Albion College disclaims any and all liability for that content, its accuracy, and opinions it may contain.\nPlease direct questions or comments to insttech@albion.edu.",

So, as eccentric professors tend to do, he moved into a 33-square-foot dumpster. Dr. Wilson affectionately became known as \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d after spending a year in the tiny dwelling.\nOver the course of 365 days, Wilson, or one of his students, spent every night in the makeshift home. The inhabitants of the dumpster had to make do with a small space, but they spruced up the place a bit. Solar panels and electrical connections were made in order for the trash container to have light and air conditioning. Other features include storage under a false floor and a weather station on the sliding roof door (it takes measurements every five minutes).\nThe dumpster sits on the campus of Houston-Tillotson University and will remain there, despite the end of the experiment.\nAlbuquerque Journal reports that Dr. Wilson will miss his time in the dumpster.\n\u201cThe last few nights have been really sweet\u2026 Identitywise, am I still Professor Dumpster if I\u2019m not living in a dumpster? I don\u2019t know if this is what my mom wanted for her first-born son.\u201d\nThe Dumpster Project was born out of a want to research sustainability. Wilson began with the hypothesis that \u201cone can have a pretty good life in and on a lot less.\u201d Essentially, the concept melted down into this: \u201cStuff is noise.\u201d Wilson and his students wanted to know if it was possible to live in a dumpster for a year, and what sort of challenges they would face in doing so.\nCongrats to @profdumpster, who just completed 1 year of living in a 33-square-foot dumpster! http://t.co/TwnPYLeeEc pic.twitter.com/DBrbQwdRFe\n\u2014 austin_monthly (@Austin_Monthly) February 5, 2015\nAccording toNBCDFW, a local NBC News affiliate, Wilson \u201cevicted\u201d himself on Wednesday during a reception on campus. The dumpster will be remaining on campus as a future teaching aid, and \u201cThe Dumpster Project \u2018Home\u2019 School\u201d will have curriculum on sustainability.\nEducators will be staying in the dumpster, according to Amanda Masino, who also teaches biology at Huston-Tillotson, and students will be given a \u201csemiridiculous challenge: Turn the dumpster into a house. What happens when you don\u2019t have constant temperature? Where do you get water? How do you treat it?\u201d\nWilson believes that having the dumpster on campus will help students understand sustainability better than \u201ctalking about it in a dry way.\u201d\nDr. Wilson did not spend the entire year in the dumpster himself. He estimates that he spent about 250 nights in the dwelling. Other nights he was travelling with his daughter or spending the night with his girlfriend. They couldn\u2019t exactly go to his place, now could they?\nDon\u2019t let the silliness of the experiment fool you; there was a more serious note to the experiment.\n\u201cIt pushes your limits. It totally blew up the idea of what a home is. In this climate, having central air and heat is more necessary than having a kitchen. But it would have been nice to have a toilet. The main complaint from students was a weak Wi-Fi signal \u2014 allegedly to do their homework.\u201d\nWilson will continue to be part of Project Dumpster, however, he has a new experiment to complete: spending 99 nights in a variety of homes all over Austin.\nWould you, or could you, spend a year in a space as small as a dumpster?\n[Image via Commons.wikipedia.org]\nShare this article: A Year In A Dumpster: Texas Professor Completes Experiment And Moves Out [Video]\nPopular On Inquisitr\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle Had an Explosive Argument and He Angrily \u2018Snapped at Her'\nMichelle and Barack Obama\u2019s Deeply Embarrassing Moment From Daughter Malia's Prom Night\nBrad Pitt Gifted Ex-wife Jennifer Aniston a $79 Million Home for Her 50th Birthday\nKris Jenner's Ex-Husband Robert Kardashian Was Allegedly Obsessed With 'Kinky' Priscilla Presley\nWhen Marjorie Taylor Greene Was Slammed By Black Women For Her Shirt Bearing the Slogan \"Say Her Name\"\nMore from Entertainment\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of use\nDMCA\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 The Inquisitr.

By illustrating the stories of families struggling against evictions, the book gives a voice to those who have remained in Detroit, showing the larger complexities at work in a beleaguered city. These are everyday people fighting back, organizing with others, going into the streets, and winning their homes back.\n \nWhat will Detroit look like in the future? Today cheap property entices real estate speculators from around the world. Artists arrive from all over viewing the city as a creative playground. Billionaires are re-sculpting downtown as a spot for tourism. But beyond the conventional players in urban growth and development, Detroit Eviction Defense (DED) members\u2014like others engaged in place-based struggles all over the country\u2014are pushing back, saying in effect, \u201cwe live here, we\u2019ve been here, there is no Detroit without us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPRAISE\n\u201cWhat makes this book remarkable is the intimately drawn true stories of ordinary people coming together to fight nefarious systems and demonstrate the possibility of winning against seemingly impossible odds. More than ever we need to believe it is possible to surmount the destructive forces that are ruining our health, our neighborhoods, our planet. Jeff Wilson and Bambi Kramer\u2019s We Live Here! demonstrates the power of the comics to do just that.\u201d \u2014Peter Kuper, co-founder of World War 3 Illustrated and contributor to The New Yorker, The Nation, and Mad\n\n\u201cJeffrey Wilson and Bambi Kramer\u2019s We Live Here is a triumph of comic art and grassroots ethnography, taking the raw and powerful testimonies of Detroit residents in the crosshairs of racial capitalism\u2019s predatory dispossession, and showing how street-level solidarity and neighborhood direct action kept people in their homes and built a movement. The panels of this book capture, with the utmost care and clear revolutionary love, the moments in which personal despair facing down foreclosure and eviction was transmuted, through organizing, into the power of community refusal. A visual and intellectual gift to anyone who wants to understand where and how truly radical responses to an unjust world are built.\u201d\n\u2014John Duda, Worker-Owner, Red Emma\u2019s Bookstore\n\n\u201cWhat a superb book of comics journalism on place-based solidarity in resisting eviction in neoliberal Detroit! A non-extractivist, publicly accessible and engaged account of the accumulative dispossessions assaulting Black and Latinx home-owners, and of racial capitalism in action. The texts and images draw us into the solidarity that enables non-white, working class resistance, deftly illustrating the nuances and complexities of the evictions, the politicization of the grass roots, their resistance as survivability, and the fight back itself.\u201d\n\u2014Loretta Lees, Director of the Initiative on Cities and Professor of Sociology, Boston University\n\n\u201cAn intimate, thought-provoking portrayal of a housing justice movement, Jeffrey Wilson and Bambi Kramer bring readers behind the scenes of Detroit\u2019s foreclosure crisis, illustrating not only how financial institutions and speculators prey on Black and Brown communities but how organized communities can succeed in fighting back. Through deft narration and arresting illustration, We Live Here celebrates place-based solidarity, illuminating its essential ingredients: love, compassion, defense, refusal, education, mutual aid, and stories. Stories of housing justice, they argue, must not only be seen and heard but also shared. This must-read handbook for housing activism does just that. Comic book meets critical urban studies, it sets an exciting new precedent for visual scholarship that is at once thorough and accessible. An achievement and inspiration.\u201d\n\u2014Sara Safransky, author of The City after Property: Abandonment and Repair in Postindustrial Detroit\n\n\u201cWilson follows up The Instinct for Cooperation (an illustrated dialogue with Noam Chomsky) by partnering with co-artist Kramer for this galvanizing chronicle of hardscrabble victories won by a grassroots coalition dedicated to rescuing Detroit families from home foreclosure and eviction. In most of the firsthand accounts, success for the Detroit Eviction Defense hinges on preventing the delivery of a dumpster, which signals the final step in an eviction. \u201cIf that happens, they\u2019ll remove you physically from the house,\u201d says an organizer at a meeting with a family threatened with eviction. While battling evictions in courtrooms and bank cubicles, the DED\u2019s most potent tactics include picket lines and crowding properties with parked cars to block dumpster deliveries. These efforts may take months, and depend on extensive volunteer commitment. In capturing the powerlessness felt by individuals pitted against unresponsive mortgage lenders, the portraits lay bare the racial disparities baked into Detroit\u2019s much-celebrated revitalization. But as DED efforts repeatedly force banks to the negotiating table, the accounts also serve as testaments to organized action and strength in numbers. Kramer\u2019s lightly stylized sketches lend each firsthand narrative a verisimilitude shaded with pathos and dignity. Personalizing the lingering aftereffects of the subprime mortgage crisis, this collection of resilient first-person testimonies is comics journalism at its most vital.\u201d\u2014Publisher\u2019s Weekly\nALSO BY JEFFREY WILSON\nSee all books by Jeffrey Wilson\nPRODUCT DETAILS\nPaperback | $16.95\nPublished by Seven Stories Press\nApr 30, 2024 | 240 Pages | 6-5/8 x 10-1/8 | ISBN 9781644212424\n\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\nQUICK VIEW\nRescue Party\nHardcover\n$25.00\nQUICK VIEW\nLiberty\nJulian Voloj\nTrade Paperback Original\n$22.99\nQUICK VIEW\nCompletely Kafka\nNicolas Mahler\nTrade Paperback Original\n$19.95\nQUICK VIEW\nAlmudena.

This experience made him embrace the minimalist lifestyle and inspired him to invent a micro-housing startup, called Kasita, in 2015. Measuring 31 x 12-feet, these tiny homes can be fitted or stacked over one another to serve as a function- home, workspace, and pop-up commercial space.\nThese prefabricated homes can be assembled off-site and delivered in two to three weeks. The stackable units can easily be installed almost anywhere on any terrain. Each unit has been designed to offer a sustainable, space-efficient and cost-efficient micro-living for changing city lifestyles.\nInside the modular units, you can find all essentials of a home, including bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen, and storage space. On raising the entry section, you\u2019ll find this underfloor storage that further leads to a sunken living/bedroom area, making the area appear more spacious.\nIt also contains a glass-clad cube-shaped section that offers undivided views of the surrounding landscape and also brings in natural daylight. The unique concept of the house also suggests a new form of real estate, allowing the homeowners to relocate their living space to any desired place. The energy is provided by directly plugging these units into any grid.\nBesides that, these micro-housing units can also be powered via renewable energies for off-grid, sustainable living. Some of these tiny homes will be ready for delivery in June 2017.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\nNATIONAL AND WORLD NEWS\nKansas judge throws out machine gun possession charge, cites Second Amendment\nby: JIM SALTER, Associated Press\nPosted: Aug 23, 2024 / 03:13 PM CDT\nUpdated: Aug 23, 2024 / 03:16 PM CDT\nSHARE\nA federal judge in Kansas has tossed out a machine gun possession charge and questioned if bans on the weapons violate the Second Amendment.\nIf upheld on appeal, the ruling by U.S. District Judge John W. Broomes in Wichita could have a sweeping impact on the regulation of machine guns, including homemade automatic weapons that many police and prosecutors blame for fueling gun violence.\nBroomes, an appointee of President Donald Trump, on Wednesday dismissed two machine gun possession counts against Tamori Morgan, who was indicted last year. Morgan was accused of possessing a model AM-15 .300-caliber machine gun and a machine gun conversion device known as a \u201cGlock switch\u201d that can make a semi-automatic weapon fire like a machine gun.\n\u201cThe court finds that the Second Amendment applies to the weapons charged because they are \u2018bearable arms\u2019 within the original meaning of the amendment,\u201d Broomes wrote. He added that the government \u201chas the burden to show that the regulation is consistent with this nation\u2019s historical firearm regulation tradition.\u201d\nAs of Friday, no appeal had been filed. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Wichita declined comment.\nFederal prosecutors in the case said in earlier court filings that the \u201cSupreme Court has made clear that regulations of machineguns fall outside the Second Amendment.\u201d\nA June 2022 Supreme Court ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen was seen as a major expansion of gun rights. The ruling said Americans have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense.\nJacob Charles, an associate law professor at Pepperdine University who tracks Second Amendment cases, said the Kansas ruling is direct fallout from the Bruen decision.\n\u201cIt gives lower court judges the ability to pick and choose the historical record in a way that they think the Second Amendment should be read,\u201d Charles said.\nCharles expects Broomes\u2019 ruling to be overturned, citing Supreme Court precedent allowing for regulation of machine guns.\nEric Ruben, a fellow at the Brennan Center and an associate law professor of Southern Methodist University, agreed.\n\u201cAs far as I know, this is the first time in American history that a machine gun ban has been found unconstitutional in its application,\u201d Ruben said.\nShira Feldman of Brady United Against Gun Violence, called the ruling \u201can incredibly dangerous decision, and it\u2019s inconsistent with what the Supreme Court has said the Second Amendment means.\u201d\nA message left Friday with the National Rifle Association wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\nCommunities across the U.S. have dealt with a surge of shootings carried out with weapons converted to fully automatic in recent years. These weapons are typically converted using small pieces of metal made with a 3D printer or ordered online.\nGuns with conversion devices have been used in several mass shootings, including one that left four dead at a Sweet Sixteen party in Alabama last year and another that left six people dead in a bar district in Sacramento, California, in 2022. In Houston, police officer William Jeffrey died in 2021 after being shot with a converted gun while serving a warrant.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported a 570% increase in the number of conversion devices collected by police departments between 2017 and 2021, the most recent data available, The Associated Press reported in March.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.
