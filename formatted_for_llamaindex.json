Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project.[4]\nJupe[edit]\nIn 2020, Wilson launched Jupe, a flat-packed housing tech startup.[5]\nKasita[edit]\nKasita Exterior\nWilson was a Co-Founder and CEO at the startup company Kasita.[6][2][7] Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies[14] and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award.[15] Wilson has referred to Kasita as a holistic integrated product, rather than a house.[16] In December 2018, Kasita was sold to a tiny house hotel company[17] in Austin, Texas.\nThe Dumpster Project[edit]\nProfessor Dumpster in front of a dumpster\nWilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)(3) non-profit 'The Dumpster Project',[18] a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home.[19] The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant[26] and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition,[27] but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal.[28] The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity.[29] On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'.[30] Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators.[31][32] On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster.[4][33] Wilson claims that the dumpster experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.[6]\n\"No Baggage\" experiment[edit]\nWilson and Bensen in No Baggage\nTogether with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' \"No Baggage\", in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website.[34][35][36] New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones [37] to screen write the film based on a book[38] from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen.[39][40][41][42] American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.[43]\n99 Nights Couchsurfing experiment[edit]\nSubsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces.[4][44] The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.[45]\nAcademic Work[edit]\nWilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston\u2013Tillotson University in Austin, Texas.[1] He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury[46] and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.[47] Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.[48]\nReferences[edit]\n^\na b Wilson, Jeff. \"Jeff Wilson, Huston Tillotson\".

(Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nAt Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas an environmental science professor teaches sustainability by example, transforming an empty dumpster into a tiny apartment where he\u2019s lived for a year. Professor Jeff Wilson tells host Steve Curwood about life in his micro home and his long-term goals for Project Dumpster.\n\n\nTranscript\nCURWOOD: Oscar the Grouch lives in a trash can. So did Popeye the Sailor Man, but it\u2019s hardly the kind of home you\u2019d expect for a college professor. Yet Dr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, is teaching sustainability by downsizing his living quarters to the dimensions of a dumpster \u2013 a clean dumpster, mind you. Jeff Wilson joins me now from his steel abode on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, where he\u2019s Dean of the University College and teaches environmental science. Welcome to Living on Earth, Jeff, or, do you prefer, \u201cProfessor Dumpster?\u201d\nWILSON: I\u2019ll take Professor Dumpster and you\u2019re at my disposal.\nCURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Right now you're in your dumpster. What kind of headroom do you have?\nWILSON: Well, it's a standard 10 cubic yard dumpster, which means it's six foot by six foot at the base. And this one's actually quite tall; it's about seven feet.\n\nProfessor Jeff Wilson makes the most of his 36 square-foot tiny house. (Photo: Sarah\nNatsumi Moore)\nCURWOOD: I have to say, it doesn't sound like you're in a metal box. What creature comforts are there with you in dampening the acoustics?\nWILSON: Right. We're actually in the second phase of this experiment turning it into an average studio apartment. First of all, I've got a wooden false floor, so the actual height of standing room is about 6'2\" right now. I've got a window unit air conditioner. I have a few tapestries hanging on the wall. I have a twin bed and then a very small bookshelf on the corner with various things like an Oscar the Grouch mug and a Dr. Who Tardis.\nCURWOOD: You moved into your dumpster about a year ago. How come?\nWILSON: So the main point of this entire experiment is to test if one can have a pretty good life on a whole lot less. This is obviously an outlier, an extreme example of that. I've moved into 36 square feet, which is 1 percent the size of the average new American home today, so that\u2019s the ultimate goal of this. A lot of people asked why we used a dumpster instead of a tiny house or instead of even a container, and the reason we did that were some of the awareness and educational aspects of this project around addressing waste. And dumpsters, you know, are these magical boxes that we put our waste into and come back a few days later after a little bit of noise in the middle of the night, which I'm very aware of at this point, [LAUGHS] that garbage truck noise, and everything's disappeared. So we want to highlight some of those subjects as well.\n\nDr. Dumpster plans to amp up his sustainability project this winter by adding amenities such as a second story, solar panels and a composting toilet. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: By the way, what risk do run from, you know, the odd garbage truck seeing the dumpster and figuring maybe it'll dump you?\nWILSON: There is a bit of confusion, especially since all the dumpsters are still labeled no entry for humans. We have a few safety features, so that I'm not serviced. We have welded shut the front pockets, they usually pick up dumpsters with. And there also happens to be a weather station on this dumpster, so even the new guy hopefully won't mistake this dumpster for a normal trash dumpster.\nCURWOOD: Now, I'm looking at a drawing from your website entitled, \"Early thoughts on proposed designs.\" Let's see, there's solar panels, a sleeping loft, air-conditioning and heating, a water collection system, even a folding balcony. To what extent have you actually transformed that 36 square feet of metal into home sweet home?\n\nProfessor Wilson stands with his girlfriend Clara Benson outside his dumpster. (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore)\nWILSON: What we're going to do in this phase is try to make this into an average American home using normal appliances. So we're going to get a fairly normal toilet, shower head; we'll probably expand out a few of the walls to give us a little bit more space to do this. The spec that you're looking at is actually the third phase, what we call the \"uber\" dumpster, and in his phase we're going to use all the baseline data that we collected using the normal sort of stuff. In this third phase we're going to utilize solar and lower-flow type equipment so that we can hopefully get to 1 percent the usage of energy and water, and 1 percent the creation of waste of an average American home.\nCURWOOD: So what about Mother Nature? I mean, particularly what do you have in the way of plumbing?\nWILSON: This is a particularly difficult issue to deal with. Not only is it not a lot of fun urinating into a bottle when it's an emergency, or running to the nearest building in the middle of the night; it's also a problem in terms of design: dealing with waste in a healthy-type way, and also one that doesn't give off much of a fragrance in such a small space, but also by coding regulation. In Austin, it's currently not legal to have a composting toilet. What we are probably going to have to do is, you know, attach something to the outside of the dumpster or expand one of the walls and just capture that blackwater like in an RV.\n\nEgress from the dumpster can be challenging. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: So, your home, Professor Wilson, the dumpster, that is, is about 1 percent of the size of the average American home, and during your experimental year you're going to try to use only 1 percent of the water and energy of the typical home and generate only 1 percent of the average waste. So far, how's it going?\nWILSON: Well, we did quite well in the first phase because we weren't plugged into water or electricity for the first six months. The only issue is that it wasn't exactly that comfortable. When I'm moved in February we had three, what they call at least in Texas \"snow days\" meaning that it got below about 35 degrees, and generally the temperature in that phase inside, was the temperature outside. What we hope to do, not only looking at newer technologies for using less water and energy and things like solar, but also thinking a little bit more carefully about what sort of activities we use water and energy for. Most people, sort of, when they move to a smaller house,or move to a tiny home, one of the things they notice is that they spend a lot more time outdoors and a lot more time in the community. And one of the things we're interested in is the increased interactions with the community and the environment when you're in a smaller home like this, sort of what that might do for one's sort of quality-of-life and sense of experience and just the overall magic that is brought into the everyday. If you want to call it dumpster magic.\n[LAUGHS]\n\nProfessor Wilson\u2019s students peek in through the dumpster\u2019s \u201cwindow\u201d. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: Well, you certainly sound like a friendly guy, and I'm sure that you have friends, lovers, perhaps. So what kinds of guests do you have at your dumpster?\nWILSON: [LAUGHS] Well, I'll start with the latter one. I did have a girlfriend at the beginning of the experiment, and it seems that she is still around at least in the last coupleof days. And a lot of people do ask if you know this is the type of experiment that attracts the ladies, and I'll say that's a definite no. I do have frequent guests here; I don't stay in the dumpster when I have these guests\u2014and these are generally students or couch surfers. I've had people from several continents couch-surf in the dumpster; we\u2019ve got a very special guest on Thursday, I actually have the CEO of \u201ccouch-surfing\u201d itself, dumpster-surfing.\nCURWOOD: And as for your girlfriend so far she hasn't dumped you.\nWILSON: So to speak and I refrain from calling her a trashy chick.\nCURWOOD: Ooooh.\nWILSON: [LAUGHS]\nCURWOOD: So your goal for dumpster dwelling goes beyond just spending a year in a small space, it's all about educating through this project dumpster. So what do you hope to accomplish?\nWILSON: In the short-term, we've really got sort of a Zen, in the moment thing going on. We're looking to reach out to the public and reach out to our students for ideas such as ideas on this toilet. It's one of the biggest problems. I mean, the idea of a toilet, the pure ridiculousness of it\u2014that you've got to have this big piece of porcelain; you've got to have a whole sewage system. You've got to have a couple gallons of fresh water. These are some of the things that I think we're able to attack in a very small way. I mean, ultimately what this experiment is all about is not just can you be happy on a lot less, but I like to think of the dumpster as a conversation box, and as long as a conversation continues to go on, whether it be about sustainability, climate change, tiny homes or whether it be\u2014as some have suggested Obama's new housing plan\u2014as long as that conversation's going on and people are talking about it, I think we'll have accomplished our goal.\nCURWOOD: Professor Jeff Wilson teaches Environmental Studies at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Great talking to you from your dumpster. I hope you'll bring it to Boston and invite us for dinner, or maybe even a sleepover.\nWILSON: Hey, Boston or Austin, mi dumpster es tu casa, so just let me know next time you\u2019re around and when we're in Boston we'll drop by.\nCURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Thank you so much.\n  Links\nProject Dumpster\nHuston-Tillotson University on Professor Jeff Wilson\nWhat It\u2019s Like To Date a Guy Who Lives In a Dumpster\nMore on issues and obstacles faced by Professor Dumpster http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/09/the-simple-life-in-a-dumpster/379947/\n  Living on Earth wants to hear from you!\nLiving on Earth\n62 Calef Highway, Suite 212\nLee, NH 03861\nTelephone: 617-287-4121\nE-mail: comments@loe.org\nNewsletter [Click here]\nDonate to Living on Earth!\nLiving on Earth is an independent media program and relies entirely on contributions from listeners and institutions supporting public service.

His work on sustainability and minimalism has been covered broadly by publications like Forbes, The Atlantic, NY Times, and The Washington Post.\n\n\nJeff talked to us about his \u201cDumpster Project\u201d as well as his previous and current startup ventures. As an entrepreneur, Jeff has founded and built a micro housing startup, Kasita, that was sold off in 2018. Jeff\u2019s latest company Jupe, has been a part of the recent Y Combinator batch, and Jeff also highlights what he learned from that experience.\n\n\nIn our conversation with Jeff we also discuss the details of how his current product works, the challenges of building a hardware company, picking the right co-founder, and\u2026 fundraising at the urinals.\nEpisode transcript\nGreg Miaskiewicz:\nSo, we'd like to talk about the very beginning stories on Startup Foundations. So how did you first become an entrepreneur? How did you get interested in big business startups, high-intensity interval capitalism?\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nI like that term. Is there an acronym?\n\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz: It's HIIC.\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nHIIC. Well, I'm a sixth generation Texan.\n\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz: Natural born HIIC.\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nSo it's a weird story. I've been an environmental science professor, a tenured professor. Safest job in the world. I decided I wanted to do this experiment around minimal living and around waste. So I convinced the university administration, to let me live in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year. An actual used trash dumpster and convert into a home. When you have aspirations as a professor of being part of the 1%, it's probably going to have nothing to do with wealth.\n\n\nSo I just went with, I'll live in 1% the volume of the average American home, own 1% of the stuff and consume 1% of the energy and water.\nSo did this and began moving my little dumpster house around the city and playing with coding officials and planning and learning how to design small spaces. And at one point, as you're laying in your dumpster at night, looking up at the heavens through the roof, this idea came to me of making the iPhone of housing. An integrated piece of hardware and software.\n\n\nOf course, there's an iPhone at Tesla and Uber and everything I learned later. But it seemed like a good\nenough idea. I moved out of the dumpster, raised my first check and started a company called Kasita.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD FULL TRANSCRIPT\nVideo Clips from Episode\nQUESTION | 2:16\nHow did you first become an entrepreneur?\nWATCH\nQUESTION | 2:26\nHow did you get your first money in the door?\nWATCH\nQUESTION | 2:41\nWhat should first-time founder look for when picking a co-founder?\nWATCH\nMore ways to listen\nSPOTIFY\nAPPLE\nSPREAKER\nGOOGLE\nRelated Episodes\nReady to get started?\nCreating a company on Capbase is as easy as filling out a few forms.\nSIGN UP NOW\nCHAT NOW\nDon't pay until you are ready to incorporate\nStartup founders use Capbase to incorporate, issue stock, raise funds, onboard new hires, and more.\nPRODUCT\nHome\nFeatures\nPricing\nHelp Center\nFAQ\nStartup Equity Calculator\nCapbase Connect\nCOMPANY\nAbout\nBlog\nPodcast\nContact\nTOPICS WE WRITE ABOUT\nSTARTUP FUNDRAISING\nINCORPORATION\nFOUNDER EQUITY\nSTARTUP EQUITY\nSTARTUP COMPLIANCE\nSTARTUP FINANCE\nGUIDES FOR BUILDING YOUR STARTUP\nFundraising For Startups\n15 ARTICLES\nHow To Set Up Your Company\n19 ARTICLES\nOngoing Compliance For Startups\n11 ARTICLES\nStartup Equity\n12 ARTICLES\nINCORPORATION MATTERS\nHow To Register A US Business From Mexico\nHow To Register a US Company from Nigeria\nDelaware Corporation Search: Check if your name is available in DE\nRead more\nFOUNDER EQUITY MATTERS\nHow Much Equity Should You Give to Your Junior Co-Founder?\nWhat Startup Founders Should Know About Capital Gains Tax\nWhat is a down round in startup financing?\nRead more\nSTARTUP EQUITY MATTERS\nLiquidation preference: A Guide For Startup Founders\nWhat is a down round in startup financing?\nPreferred Stock: Quick Guide For Startup Founders\nRead more\nTerms of servicePrivacy policy",

The dumpster has got little but a mattress, A/C window unit, and a false floor under which he can keep his clothing and cooking equipment.\nThe backstory on Wilson\u2019s decision to begin the experiment is basically what you might expect, if you had to guess. As the Washington Post explained in its exit-interview with Wilson, after he moved out of his dumpster home: \n[H]e was living in a comfortable, 3,000-square-foot Brownsville, Tex., home with a large walk-in closet, an easily accessible bathroom and a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. He had a tenure-track professorship at a state university, an hour-long commute and a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\nToday, Wilson has none of those things \u2014 and insists that he\u2019s never been happier.\nBetween then and now, there was a divorce, a new job in a new city, a surrendering of worldly possessions, a new social arrangement with a new romantic partner and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 an olive green dumpster that he called home.\nWilson\u2019s stunt got lots of attention because the ideas behind Wilson\u2019s dumpster life are fashionable. The \u201cTiny Houses\u201d movement has picked up speed in the wake of the 2007-2008 recession. IKEA stores, perhaps in a nod to their European roots, make big shows of demonstrating how comfortable a two-hundred-square-foot living space can be. \nAccording to the FAQ on the Dumpster Project website, the focus of Wilson\u2019s year-long stunt was much bigger than just one professor: \nThis whole endeavor is way more than a weird professor living in a metal wastebasket. Beyond the obvious goal of creating one of the smallest sustainable living spaces on the planet, the project is heavily focused on engaging students and enhancing the Huston-Tillotson campus where it\u2019s located. Ultimately we\u2019re partnering with students to create a lively (and entertaining) discussion about what a good, sustainable life can look like and how to make that life available to more communities.\nAlthough Wilson\u2019s website may have noted that \u201cif all goes well, Professor Dumpster has stated that he is not opposed to taking up permanent residence in his dumpster dwelling,\u201d he\u2019s out of it now\u2014and of course he\u2019s on to his next project. \nThe new social experiment or whatever it is that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin. Pretty self-explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime\u2014right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nPOPULAR VIDEOS\nPrevious\nNext\nThe Story: Writer Sarah Hepola on \"What Cheer Led To\"\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 13 seconds\nMORE\nThe Story: Writer Sarah Hepola on \"What Cheer Led To\"\nThe Best Mexico City Street Tacos in Austin\nLet\u2019s just quickly acknowledge the irony that a guy whose famously minimalist lifestyle included \u201ceight or nine bowties\u201d is now mocking hipster trappings like music festivals and craft-beer tastings. Okay, moving on, his project appears to be a bit of Morgan Spurlock-like first-person investigation: Wilson will sleep on couches to see a variety of ways that people in Austin live, with a photographer and writer in tow to document the experience. He is also seeking sponsors.\nBut how revelatory can 99 Nights ATX really be? The project will limit him to a self-selected group of homes by its nature\u2014he can only go where he\u2019s invited, obviously\u2014and it\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms, though it seems mostly harmless. (update: after this post went live, Wilson removed the \u201cpartners\u201d link from the 99 Nights ATX website; the page is cached here.)\nStill, if your reaction to all of Wilson\u2019s projects is that something feels off, well, you\u2019re not alone. Most stories about Wilson feature commentary from readers who take issue with the fact that he\u2019s becoming a minor celebrity through these gimmicks, and that\u2019s understandable. \nThere are already people who live in dumpsters without A/C units or garden gnomes or eight to nine bowties, of course\u2014it\u2019s just that they\u2019re homeless. They\u2019re unlikely to end up enjoying media attention from \u201cThe Atlantic, MSNBC, NPR, BBC, HuffPo, USA Today, CNET, Fast Company, The Guardian,The Weather Channel, Al Jazeera & 200+ others,\u201d as the page on his 99 Nights website boasts. They don\u2019t get sponsorship opportunities at all, and they\u2019re unlikely to be able to parlay their experience into a book deal, something Wilson told the Washington Post was on his agenda.\nSimilarly, there are a lot of people who sleep on couches whose \u201csocial experiment\u201d is based on having nowhere else to go. The National Coalition for the Homeless reports that an estimated 1.65 percent of the population is \u201ccouch-homeless,\u201d or people who have no permanent residence but stay with friends or family. In Dallas youth shelter Promise House claimed in 2008 that roughly one thousand homeless teenagers in the city are \u201csofa-surfers\u201d (full disclosure: my mother-in-law is the former executive director of Promise House). In the UK, sofa-surfing homelessness is an issue getting serious attention as part of a campaign to consider the mostly-invisible homeless population.\nWilson\u2019s website talked about sustainability and furthering the availability of sustainable living to more communities, but his own project was buoyed by extensive corporate sponsorship from Ford and Freescale as well as other corporations, and a pair of local hipster home outfitting retailers interested in being associated with Wilson\u2019s impressive media reach. (If any of these sponsors want to invest in things that benefit people in need of low-cost sustainable housing, we might suggest a few other worthy causes.)\nAlso, living in a dumpster is also actually illegal, unless you happen to own the dumpster in question. (Wilson was able to secure permission to occupy his particular dumpster from the university.)\nNone of that makes the fun, quirky \u201cexperiments\u201d that Wilson is performing wrong, but it does make them kind of obtuse. Wilson\u2019s experiments are fundamentally about homelessness\u2014you don\u2019t move into a dumpster unaware of the association\u2014but when he talks about \u201cWhat does home look like in a world of ten billion people\u201d by celebrating the gimmicks behind what he\u2019s doing, there\u2019s an important thing he\u2019s missing: for many people, it just looks a lot like living in a f#%$ing dumpster.  \nWe certainly don\u2019t wish Wilson ill as he brings his bowties into 99 different people\u2019s homes, but it\u2019s hard not to see these projects as very interesting ways for the guy to get on television and in magazines, creating opportunities for corporate partners to co-brand #DumpsterLife or #CouchSurfing as a quirky way to challenge middle-class conceptions of how we live. But if the majority of the time we spend talking about people who live in dumpsters or on other people\u2019s couches involves a university professor on the hunt for a book deal, we\u2019re not creating an interesting dialogue. We\u2019re avoiding one. \n(AP Photo/Austin American-Statesman, Laura Skelding.)\nHome\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nEmail a link to this page\nComments\n0\nShow More\nRECOMMENDED\nSTYLE & DESIGN\n\u201cGranny Flats\u201d Could Remake the Housing Market.

This is relevant to the story only because New Line Cinema bought the rights to turn that story into a rom-com.\nIn 2014, Wilson moved into a dumpster behind the women\u2019s dormitory at Huston-Tillotson University in East Austin. Over the past year, Wilson converted the dumpster into a tiny home, complete with air conditioning \u2014 it is Austin, after all \u2014 as well as the full support of the university where he is both professor and dean of the University College. A student group, Green Is the New Black, helped him with his project and slept in the dumpster on nights when Wilson elected to sleep elsewhere.\nThis is where people, including me, begin to project their own emotions onto the story: why did he pick the dumpster behind the women\u2019s dorm? Why do I feel weird about students sleeping over in their professor\u2019s living space, even if he isn\u2019t there? How does Wilson balance dumpster life with parenting his elementary-school-aged daughter? (Wilson is divorced and it appears that his ex-wife has primary custody of their daughter.)\nAnd here\u2019s one new emotion that I just picked up this morning: why did none of the Professor Dumpster articles that I read over the past year, not until the Washington Post profile I read today, mention that Huston-Tillotson University is an Historically Black College? If there are students of color who helped Professor Dumpster build his dumpster house, their faces should have been photographed next to his, alongside his bow tie and his Stetson.\nBut we don\u2019t have to worry about any of that anymore, because Professor Dumpster is moving out of the dumpster \u2014 and if you live in Austin, he might be coming to a couch near you.\nAs the Texas Monthly reports, in an article titled \u201cWhy Professor Dumpster\u2019s Gimmicks are a Bunch of Trash:\u201d\nThe new social experiment or whatever that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin \u2014 pretty self explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime \u2014 right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nYes, Professor Dumpster is going couchsurfing. (Hat tip to Billfold commenter Josh for sending us the Texas Monthly link.) The Texas Monthly notes that he\u2019s also looking for project funding \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms\u201d \u2014 but when I follow the link to his 99 Nights ATX sponsor page it looks like he\u2019s actually looking for corporate sponsors, which probably has more to do with raising the profile of his experiment than crowdfunding his couchsurfing.\nHere\u2019s how 99 Nights ATX describes the project:\nJeff will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their inner spaces. Sarah Natsumi Moore, an established Austin photographer, will document the journey with her camera and Clara Bensen, a local writer, will compile short stories to accompany each home.\nWe will learn a lot about the former Professor Dumpster and his team by the people he chooses to stay with and the stories his team chooses to tell about them.\nAfter all, it\u2019s pretty clear what story I\u2019m choosing to tell about Professor Dumpster.\nPhoto credit: PhotoAtelier\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\nDistraction-free reading.

Eventually, he hopes to turn his new home into a full-on \u201cspace capsule in a trash can\u201d with WiFi, air conditioning, an Xbox and other modern luxuries. The yearlong class experiment, called The Dumpster Project, is out to prove that people can live in a lot less space but still have a rich\u2014if not richer\u2014life.\nWho did you consult with for the project?\nI recruited a world-class team that includes one of the top green designers in the world, one of the top water energy experts and people in the STEM education community. They\u2019re acting as an advisory board. But the students do the real design and thought-process work on this.\nWhy a dumpster and not some other small space?\nYou get a very shocking reaction when you tell people at a cocktail party that you\u2019re living in a dumpster. They don\u2019t say, \u201cThat\u2019s great. The weather tomorrow looks terrible.\u201d The experiment fuels a very long conversation within and between groups that don\u2019t traditionally talk about issues of living with less and sustainability.\nAny thoughts on how this will affect your personal life?\nMy mom is a Martha Stewart\u2013type and very concerned about image. If someone brings it up at her bridge club, it pokes her a little bit, but I think she secretly likes it. My girlfriend has always known [about the project]. I think once I actually move in, it will become difficult. I\u2019m on campus, so there are visitation hours.\nWill you be entertaining in your new place?\nOh yeah. We\u2019re going to have a dumpster-warming party when I move in. I want to have a couple of chairs out in the yard and a little back porch. It\u2019s one of the best views in Austin. A thousand-dollar home with a million-dollar view.\nPopular Articles\nWhy Is Austin Dating So Cursed?\nA Major Developer\u2019s Collapse Leaves Abandoned Projects Scattered Across Austin\nThe 25 Best Tacos in Austin\n50 Great Dates in Austin\n6 Texas Beaches Just a Short Drive From Austin\nWhat\u2019s With All These Breakups in Austin?\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nCurrent Issue\nArchives\nTRENDING NOW\n1907\u2019s Chill Summer, and Other Austin Weather Records That Might Surprise You\nThe Highland Lakes Are Rising Again!

Wilson, college dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is highlighted for his daring challenge to live inside of a 33-square-foot trash container. It\u2019s all part of the Dumpster Project, an experiment he\u2019s developing with students to build a \u201clow-impact, zero-net-waste\u201d dwelling out of the trash container.\nIt was interesting to learn about how many items of convenience Wilson has stripped from his life to place himself basically in solitary confinement: He\u2019s got no toilet or shower (he uses the university\u2019s), no washer and dryer for his clothes (he uses the laundromat), and his wardrobe is reduced to a few pairs of pants and shirts, three hats, and \u201ceight or nine\u201d bowties.\nIt\u2019s basically a crib \u2014 though when finally complete, it will be something that could possibly revive MTV Cribs. Here\u2019s what it will look like:\nGrist Weekly | The best of Grist\u2019s essential climate reporting, delivered straight to your inbox every Saturday.\nSign up now\n  This was not mentioned in the story, but his school, Huston-Tillotson, is a historically black university. The student group Hamblin does mention, Green is the New Black, is the Huston-Tillotson student organization that is driving the Dumpster Project, and it is holding its inaugural Building Green Justice Forum on campus on Sept. 25.\nHuston-Tillotson is spotlighted in the a report I just wrote about that highlights environmental work and progress at historically black schools. In particular Huston-Tillotson gets props for its Dumpster 101 curriculum, based on this project, and also its off-campus activity, like the STEM program it\u2019s created for K-12 classes. It\u2019s kinda criminal that this university didn\u2019t make the Sierra Club\u2019s or Princeton\u2019s \u201cgreenest schools\u201d lists based on this dumpster-ology alone.\nWhich brings me to another item left out of the story: That East Austin, where Wilson\u2019s dumpster home and the university are located, is an area where African Americans and Latinos have historically lived segregated from the rest of the city. This racial segregation is by design, which you can read about in Cecilia Balli\u2019s Texas Monthly story, or Luke Winkie\u2019s in Vice. It\u2019s part of why Austin is considered the 10th most segregated city in the nation.\nEast Austin is showing signs of gentrification, however. And Wilson himself could be easily taken for one of those caricatured-too-much hipsters encroaching upon black territory. He\u2019s white. He has \u201ceight or nine bowties.\u201d But his Dumpster story charts a different path.\nThe lack of space in Wilson\u2019s pod has pushed him into more intimate contact with his neighbors. As noted in the story:\nHe spent a lot more time out in the community, just walking around. \u201cI almost feel like East Austin is my home and backyard,\u201c he said. He is constantly thinking about what sorts of things a person really needs in a house, and what can be more communal.\n\u201cWhat if everybody had to go to some sort of laundromat?\u201d Wilson posited. \u201cHow would that shift how we have to, or get to, interact with others? I know I have met a much wider circle of people just from going to laundromats and wandering around outside of the dumpster when I would\u2019ve been in there if I had a large flat screen and a La-Z Boy.\u201d \u2026\nHe\u2019s also welcoming of anyone who wants to stop by the dumpster and talk sustainability any time. \u2026 On some nights, Wilson will stay with a friend, and students from the ecology-focused campus group Green Is the New Black will get a night to stay in the dumpster.\nOne of the biggest gripes about gentrification is that the invasive species moving in often seclude themselves from the natives, throwing off community chemistry. But Wilson\u2019s dumpster is not a white sanctuary among black residents. Community is part of his intention. Also, since his place of rest is not a house, his occupation has not lead to someone else\u2019s displacement, another prime feature of gentrification.\nNow obviously we can\u2019t all live in dumpsters to avoid pushing people out of their homes. But I like the kind of thinking that Wilson\u2019s dumpster model hopefully inspires: How can we get in front of the problems often created in the gentrifying process? One way is not to ignore race, but rather to purposefully engage  it.\nA message from   \nAll donations matched for a limited time!\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the 'new 1%' will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home,\" reads The Dumpster Project website.\nWe first came across Wilson over at The Atlantic, where they describe his downsizing from a 2,500-square-foot house to a 500-square-foot apartment and finally to the 36-square-foot dumpster. For reference, that's 152 square feet less than the self-proclaimed \"world's smallest house\" in London, 204 square feet less than a typical $30,000 tiny house, and 92 square feet smaller than the tiny house in which a Business Insider reporter spent the weekend with her mom.\nAdvertisement\nWe were so intrigued by Wilson's project that we reached out to Team Dumpster to see if it had photos to share. We've published them here with the group's permission.\nAdvertisement\nThe Dumpster Project will be completed in three phases, starting when Wilson took occupancy in February 2014: camping in a bare-bones dumpster (shown here); living in a dumpster \"home,\" with additions such as storage and a bed; and then fine-tuning the dumpster into the ultimate sustainable home.\nSarah Natsumi Moore / The Dumpster Project\nEarlier in stage two, the project's current stage, a fake floor was installed to store Wilson's belongings and limited wardrobe.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nLater in this stage, the dumpster will be hooked up to electricity and water.

Wilson is documenting his progress on the website dumpsterproject.org, using videos and social media to showcase his sustainable living project.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just to explore the idea of less,\u201d he told ABC station KTRK in Houston.\nProfessor Goes Green: He\u2019ll Live in Dumpster for a Year\nStudents, who helped clean the dumpster before Wilson moved in, were stunned when he announced his plan.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at all,\u201d student Charles Deshaw said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re really going to live in a dumpster?\u2019\u201d\nJeff Wilson is using a dumpster as his home at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Tx.\nThe front door slides shut. It\u2019s cold at nights. The walls contain decorative hangings. The home features few appliances such as a washer and dryer, which were added during the current phase of his project. The third and final phase will feature solar panels with a focus on renewable energy.\nFor Wilson -- who goes by the nickname \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d -- the second night in the dumpster was scariest.\n\u201cThe trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors,\u201d Wilson told KTRK.\nLuckily, Wilson\u2019s new home remained untouched by trash crews. After living in the dumpster for six months, Wilson is proud of the discourse his experiment has encouraged and that it has promoted the idea of living with less.\nIt\u2019s important to \u201cfoster a conversation and keep that conversation going.

This is relevant to the story only because New Line Cinema bought the rights to turn that story into a rom-com.\nIn 2014, Wilson moved into a dumpster behind the women\u2019s dormitory at Huston-Tillotson University in East Austin. Over the past year, Wilson converted the dumpster into a tiny home, complete with air conditioning \u2014 it is Austin, after all \u2014 as well as the full support of the university where he is both professor and dean of the University College. A student group, Green Is the New Black, helped him with his project and slept in the dumpster on nights when Wilson elected to sleep elsewhere.\nThis is where people, including me, begin to project their own emotions onto the story: why did he pick the dumpster behind the women\u2019s dorm? Why do I feel weird about students sleeping over in their professor\u2019s living space, even if he isn\u2019t there? How does Wilson balance dumpster life with parenting his elementary-school-aged daughter? (Wilson is divorced and it appears that his ex-wife has primary custody of their daughter.)\nAnd here\u2019s one new emotion that I just picked up this morning: why did none of the Professor Dumpster articles that I read over the past year, not until the Washington Post profile I read today, mention that Huston-Tillotson University is an Historically Black College? If there are students of color who helped Professor Dumpster build his dumpster house, their faces should have been photographed next to his, alongside his bow tie and his Stetson.\nBut we don\u2019t have to worry about any of that anymore, because Professor Dumpster is moving out of the dumpster \u2014 and if you live in Austin, he might be coming to a couch near you.\nAs the Texas Monthly reports, in an article titled \u201cWhy Professor Dumpster\u2019s Gimmicks are a Bunch of Trash:\u201d\nThe new social experiment or whatever that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin \u2014 pretty self explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime \u2014 right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nYes, Professor Dumpster is going couchsurfing. (Hat tip to Billfold commenter Josh for sending us the Texas Monthly link.) The Texas Monthly notes that he\u2019s also looking for project funding \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms\u201d \u2014 but when I follow the link to his 99 Nights ATX sponsor page it looks like he\u2019s actually looking for corporate sponsors, which probably has more to do with raising the profile of his experiment than crowdfunding his couchsurfing.\nHere\u2019s how 99 Nights ATX describes the project:\nJeff will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their inner spaces. Sarah Natsumi Moore, an established Austin photographer, will document the journey with her camera and Clara Bensen, a local writer, will compile short stories to accompany each home.\nWe will learn a lot about the former Professor Dumpster and his team by the people he chooses to stay with and the stories his team chooses to tell about them.\nAfter all, it\u2019s pretty clear what story I\u2019m choosing to tell about Professor Dumpster.\nPhoto credit: PhotoAtelier\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\nDistraction-free reading.

This is a question best pondered, it seems, from the inside of a Dumpster \u2013 which is why Jeff Wilson, a dean and associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, decided to move into one this past February. It seemed the perfect testing ground for the theory that \"less is more.\" Wilson intends to stay there one year, during which time \u2013 assuming all goes well with a $100,000 Kickstarter campaign ending July 1 \u2013 he and students will transform the Dumpster into a \"sustainable house and interactive teaching lab\" that uses only \"1% of the water, energy, and space of the average American home.\" As Wilson likes to say, \"It's the new one percent.\"\nAccording to the current design proposal on Kickstarter, the Dumpster's final stage of transformation (\"Phase 3: Space Capsule \u00dcber Dumpster\") will feature a \"pop-up\" second story, sleeping loft, \"folding balcony,\" composting toilet, solar shower, and rooftop rain collection system. For portability, it will tuck back together into its original form like George Jetson's briefcase. The whole experiment will be accessible \"in real time\" thanks to \"dumpster cams and a data feed with current dumpster conditions.\"\nFinal plans for a livable Dumpster (Image courtesy of Jeff Wilson)\nCurrent Dumpster conditions for now are more modest and mosquito-ridden \u2013 though, as Wilson notes, \"What's nice about a 33-square-foot house is you can just net the whole thing.\" While he's become adept at leaping through the Dumpster's side window, he provides guests with a repurposed swimming-pool ladder. Inside, all appears clean, thanks to a vigorous run through a \"car wash on steroids\" at the Texas Disposal Systems' facility. None\u00adthe\u00adless, says Wilson, \"My girlfriend swears she can still smell a hint of barbecue. Maybe we got lucky and got a Dumpster from behind Franklin's Bar\u00adbecue.\" Art by Wilson's 6-year-old daughter adorns the walls, solar-powered gadgets charge his iPhone and track indoor temperature, and raised floor panels hide clothes stored underneath. At night, he sleeps on a Kazakh mat. Being an inch taller than the Dumpster is wide, he lies diagonally across the six-by-six-foot space (along the hypotenuse, in professor language). In the mornings, he makes Turkish coffee and tends his garden with water lugged by foot from Lady Bird Lake.\nThere is also a considerable element of theatre. Notably, Wilson does these things while donning the role of his bespectacled, bow tie-clad alter ego, \"Professor Dump\u00adster.\" With an affinity for pithy bons mots and puns (his email signature is \"at your disposal\"), Wilson has infused the project with a winking irreverence. His move-in during February's long cold spell drew news coverage from as far away as the UK, which suggests that the Dumpster is precisely the \"conversation box\" it's intended to be. The Professor also appeals to students. In the spring, Blackshear Ele\u00adment\u00adary School fifth graders joined in to test soil, filter water, and build garden beds. At year's end, Professor Dumpster spoke at the students' graduation. This kind of hands-on learning is particularly meaningful, says Blackshear Principal Betty Jen\u00adkins, and it builds much-needed college awareness.\nAmanda Masino, an HT assistant professor of biology, helps develop \"experiential, design-based, and inquiry-based\" curricula around the project, using \"the same challenge but modifying it based on grade level,\" she says. A Dumpster 101 class brings HT students into the project, which is generating lessons beyond simply tracking energy and water use. Students will be analyzing DNA swabbed from the Dump\u00adster's interior, for example, and sampling Wilson's blood to track his stress levels. There are also policy issues to be explored, such as the limits building codes impose on design.\nThe project has significance for students beyond the classroom. Last fall, they thought it was \"strange\" when Wilson proposed living in a Dumpster, says sophomore Angelica Erazo, but they rallied around the sustainability idea. \"We decided to come up with an organization to help push that issue, as well as create environmental awareness in the Eastside community,\" she says. Erazo co-founded Green Is the New Black, a student group promoting a campuswide initiative to reduce water and energy use. The organization recently won $10,000 from Home Depot in the Retool Your School challenge. The group is also focused on bringing minorities into the environmental conversations of which, Erazo notes, they've often been left out. Because affordability is a major part of that conversation for low-income communities, she hopes to clear up the misconception that being environmentally friendly has to be expensive. \"You can save money being green,\" she says, pointing to simple behaviors like turning off the lights.\nThe Dumpster Project is not one of those money-saving endeavors \u2013 at least not yet. While the point right now is to bring the brightest designers and best technological expertise to the experiment, says Wilson, affordability is central to the ultimate goal of developing a sustainable model of living. \"This may be a $100,000 Dumpster home,\" says Wilson, \"but the next project might be the tiniest house built to code, and the next could be a tiny home for under $20,000.\"\nGot something to say on the subject?

This is a question best pondered, it seems, from the inside of a Dumpster \u2013 which is why Jeff Wilson, a dean and associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, decided to move into one this past February. It seemed the perfect testing ground for the theory that \"less is more.\" Wilson intends to stay there one year, during which time \u2013 assuming all goes well with a $100,000 Kickstarter campaign ending July 1 \u2013 he and students will transform the Dumpster into a \"sustainable house and interactive teaching lab\" that uses only \"1% of the water, energy, and space of the average American home.\" As Wilson likes to say, \"It's the new one percent.\"\nAccording to the current design proposal on Kickstarter, the Dumpster's final stage of transformation (\"Phase 3: Space Capsule \u00dcber Dumpster\") will feature a \"pop-up\" second story, sleeping loft, \"folding balcony,\" composting toilet, solar shower, and rooftop rain collection system. For portability, it will tuck back together into its original form like George Jetson's briefcase. The whole experiment will be accessible \"in real time\" thanks to \"dumpster cams and a data feed with current dumpster conditions.\"\nFinal plans for a livable Dumpster (Image courtesy of Jeff Wilson)\nCurrent Dumpster conditions for now are more modest and mosquito-ridden \u2013 though, as Wilson notes, \"What's nice about a 33-square-foot house is you can just net the whole thing.\" While he's become adept at leaping through the Dumpster's side window, he provides guests with a repurposed swimming-pool ladder. Inside, all appears clean, thanks to a vigorous run through a \"car wash on steroids\" at the Texas Disposal Systems' facility. None\u00adthe\u00adless, says Wilson, \"My girlfriend swears she can still smell a hint of barbecue. Maybe we got lucky and got a Dumpster from behind Franklin's Bar\u00adbecue.\" Art by Wilson's 6-year-old daughter adorns the walls, solar-powered gadgets charge his iPhone and track indoor temperature, and raised floor panels hide clothes stored underneath. At night, he sleeps on a Kazakh mat. Being an inch taller than the Dumpster is wide, he lies diagonally across the six-by-six-foot space (along the hypotenuse, in professor language). In the mornings, he makes Turkish coffee and tends his garden with water lugged by foot from Lady Bird Lake.\nThere is also a considerable element of theatre. Notably, Wilson does these things while donning the role of his bespectacled, bow tie-clad alter ego, \"Professor Dump\u00adster.\" With an affinity for pithy bons mots and puns (his email signature is \"at your disposal\"), Wilson has infused the project with a winking irreverence. His move-in during February's long cold spell drew news coverage from as far away as the UK, which suggests that the Dumpster is precisely the \"conversation box\" it's intended to be. The Professor also appeals to students. In the spring, Blackshear Ele\u00adment\u00adary School fifth graders joined in to test soil, filter water, and build garden beds. At year's end, Professor Dumpster spoke at the students' graduation. This kind of hands-on learning is particularly meaningful, says Blackshear Principal Betty Jen\u00adkins, and it builds much-needed college awareness.\nAmanda Masino, an HT assistant professor of biology, helps develop \"experiential, design-based, and inquiry-based\" curricula around the project, using \"the same challenge but modifying it based on grade level,\" she says. A Dumpster 101 class brings HT students into the project, which is generating lessons beyond simply tracking energy and water use. Students will be analyzing DNA swabbed from the Dump\u00adster's interior, for example, and sampling Wilson's blood to track his stress levels. There are also policy issues to be explored, such as the limits building codes impose on design.\nThe project has significance for students beyond the classroom. Last fall, they thought it was \"strange\" when Wilson proposed living in a Dumpster, says sophomore Angelica Erazo, but they rallied around the sustainability idea. \"We decided to come up with an organization to help push that issue, as well as create environmental awareness in the Eastside community,\" she says. Erazo co-founded Green Is the New Black, a student group promoting a campuswide initiative to reduce water and energy use. The organization recently won $10,000 from Home Depot in the Retool Your School challenge. The group is also focused on bringing minorities into the environmental conversations of which, Erazo notes, they've often been left out. Because affordability is a major part of that conversation for low-income communities, she hopes to clear up the misconception that being environmentally friendly has to be expensive. \"You can save money being green,\" she says, pointing to simple behaviors like turning off the lights.\nThe Dumpster Project is not one of those money-saving endeavors \u2013 at least not yet. While the point right now is to bring the brightest designers and best technological expertise to the experiment, says Wilson, affordability is central to the ultimate goal of developing a sustainable model of living. \"This may be a $100,000 Dumpster home,\" says Wilson, \"but the next project might be the tiniest house built to code, and the next could be a tiny home for under $20,000.\"\nGot something to say on the subject?

He\u2019s an environmental science professor at Huston-Tillotson University (HTU) AND a dean!\nI had to meet him when I flew into Austin for a board meeting earlier this month.\nWhat\u2019s his story?\nHe\u2019s the test variable in his own research, exploring the boundaries of conventional living options.\nCan one live in a space of 36-square feet?\nThe first half of the year, he endured sparse amenities, sponge baths at a sink in one of the university\u2019s bathrooms, and sub-freezing nights. The second half of the year, he added some creature comforts with air conditioning and a futon bed.\nAs a professor, he inspires by example. His students remain curious about sustainability in their own lives. He welcomes teachers to spend a night through his Dumpster Project \u201cHome\u201d School residency program. (Scroll to \u201cEducation Programs\u201d in the PDF that opens.) His DumpterProject.org even offers educational opportunities for 5th and 7th grade science\u2014helping young people understand sustainability of water, food, and energy.\nWhat unfolded was quite unexpected.\nWe met for breakfast on a rainy morning at a small neighborhood restaurant two miles east of the Capitol.\nDonning a professorial corduroy sport coat over a plaid shirt with bowtie, and heavy black-framed glasses topped with a Stetson will catch anyone\u2019s attention!  That adventurous mix caught mine.\nHe is letting go.\nHe picked up the tab for breakfast. I objected since I had invited him to meet with me. He explained that\u2019s what the money is for\u2014to let it go. Although, he\u2019s not giving away money, he is testing many of the conventions of day-to-day living we often take for granted.\nHe just sold his car the evening before we met, choosing to get around town on an electric bicycle or on foot.\nAfter breakfast, we walked to the University to see the Dumpster. I looked inside and took a few pictures. (It had just been painted.) We went to his office to continue our discussion.\nWhat is he trying to prove?\nHe\u2019s asked this question, frequently. Anytime, anyone endeavors to do something that defies convention, amateur psychologists gather to decode the pioneer\u2019s psyche by delving into the past.\nWas it something from his childhood?\n I was curious about his childhood. He recalls trying to arrange Legos in ways that reflect principles of feng shui. He remembers most horizontal surfaces filled with stuff. In STUFFology 101, there\u2019s a reference to tilting horizontal surfaces to prevent the accumulation of POOP (Piles of Overwhelming Paperwork).\nA past relationship?\nHe was married once, but his ex-wife\u2019s and his relationship went their separate ways, amicably.\nPast profession?\nAfter a stint with Ernst & Young, he quit, because in the real world, it seems no matter how stellar one\u2019s results, there\u2019s always a leader wants things done a certain way.\nSometimes, people do things for reasons we\u2019re unable to understand.\nHe\u2019s not trying to change our behavior.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to do anything.\u201d He doesn\u2019t expect the world\u2019s population to live in dumpsters. Although, a dumpster would be desirable shelter for billions who live in poverty.\nHe\u2019s not even trying to prove a point.\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing my own thing.\u201d He\u2019s stretching the boundaries of how we choose to live while exploring sustainable options. He\u2019s conducting \u201cradical personal experiments that have the potential to make a ripple in society.\u201d He\u2019s \u201cinspired by people who sell their home, buy an RV, and travel. It\u2019s a freeing feeling.\u201d\nWhy a Dumpster?\n\u201cThe dumpster is a metaphor for the dichotomy between our sacred space (where we live) and the waste we throw away. The crap we don\u2019t want disappears when we toss it in a dumpster.\u201d Bringing together such disparate elements \u201cserves as a symbol and a surprise.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next?\nHis goal is to explore \u201chow to build a beautiful home for the price of a car payment in the middle of a city.\u201d\nHis research is inspiring. His experiments are lessons in letting go while letting in the world of adventure through sustainable living. He inspires a growing community of us with greater awareness of the cumulative global impact of our feature-rich lifestyles.\nBy letting go of things we often think are necessary, he has created a life of freedom, flexibility, and fun. For example, he and his girlfriend/writer, Clara Bensen, completed several trips to different countries around the world without any baggage. Read more on his Wikipedia page.\nI hope he doesn\u2019t let go of the gift of STUFFology 101: Get Your Mind out of the Clutter, I was happy to sign for him.\n  Tags: Letting go, piles of overwhelming paperwork, POOP, Professor Dumpster, STUFFology 101 book\nYou might also like\n1\nREPLY\nEric Riddle STUFFologist\nApril 23, 2015 at 8:56 am\nWow, talk about letting go of stuff!\nThere is some pretty cool information as you click through the various links.

For \u201cThe Ultimate Conversation Box: A Dumpster,\u201d Dr. Wilson will be describing how he links his academic research, teaching, and community activism with issues of sustainability as well as with his role as a dean at Huston-Tillotson University. Wilson will also give a \u201ctour\u201d of his dumpster/home.\nHere\u2019s what a recent piece in The Atlantic had to say about him:\nProfessor Wilson went to the dumpster not just because he wished to live deliberately, and not just to teach his students about the environmental impacts of day-to-day life, and not just to gradually transform the dumpster into \u201cthe most thoughtfully-designed, tiniest home ever constructed.\u201d Wilson\u2019s reasons are a tapestry of these things.\n[\u2026]\nNot long ago, Wilson was nesting in a 2,500 square foot house. After going through a divorce (\u201cnothing related to the dumpster,\u201d he told me, unsolicited), he spun into the archetypal downsizing of a newly minted bachelor. He moved into a 500-square-foot apartment. Then he began selling clothes and furniture on Facebook for almost nothing. Now he says almost everything he owns is in his 36-square-foot dumpster, which is sanctioned and supported by the university as part of an ongoing sustainability-focused experiment called The Dumpster Project. \u201cWe could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson said at the launch, \u201c[fueled by] sunlight and surface water, and people could have a pretty good life.\u201d\n[\u2026]\nFor Professor Dumpster, the undertaking is at once grand and diminutive, selfless and introspective, silly and gravely important, even dark. \u201cWe bring everything into the home these days,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to leave the home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home.\u201d\n\u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\nThe talk will take place Friday, September 26 at 4:30 in Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s AL Auditorium at 900 Chicon Street.\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Department of American Studies, the Graduate Program in Community and Regional Planning, and Plan II Honors.

An environmental science professor is making a 33-square-foot dumpster his new home for the next year.\nHis name is Dr. Jeff Wilson, but since embarking on this journey, he's now going by Professor Dumpster.\nHe teaches at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, and received his Ph.D. from Harvard.\nThe goal is to embrace energy efficiency, and to prove that it is possible to live on a smaller scale - a much smaller scale.\nThis whole project revolves around using one percent of what an average American uses: one percent of the water, energy and waste.\nDr. Jeff Wilson checks out his new 33 square foot dumpster home. (Credit: @profdumpster/Instagram)\n\"We really needed some sort of excitement around science, sustainability and technology,\" says Wilson.\nHe says the idea came to him over two years ago. Since then he's been recruiting a world-class team of professors, scientists and environmentalists to make his idea a reality.\n\"My hypothesis is that my life will be better,\" Wilson says. \"I'll be fulfilling a richer life by living a smaller life.\"\nLast night was the first night in his new home. Wilson says that in this phase of the project, the only thing he has to keep him warm during the cold Texas nights is his sleeping bag.\nHe's embracing the simplicity, and welcoming the changes that will come in the next year of the project. Instead of being strapped down to expensive monthly rent, he'll be a homeowner with his mortgage paid off.\nBut dumpster living comes with challenges, like walking a mile down the hill to the town lake for water.\nThe outlook is positive, though. Wilson says in six months he hopes to have things like an air conditioner and an X-box. A shower, a toilet and even WiFi is in the works, too.\nDr. Wilson has a whole team behind him, including a student organization called Green is the New Black. He says team members can even volunteer to spend the night in the dumpster and give him the night off. As the project progresses, the team will be fundraising for low-energy appliances and electronics, and will monitor the energy used on the team's blog.\nHe'll be taking his dumpster home to local elementary schools and sharing his project with the students. It gives the students the opportunity to give him design ideas and ask questions. One of the most pressing so far: \"How is Santa going to get in?\"\nTo follow Dr. Wilson and his team's journey through dumpster living, check out the blog at dumpsterproject.org.\nABC News Network Privacy Policy Your US State Privacy Rights Children's Online Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads Terms of Use Do Not Sell My Info Contact Us \u00a9 2024 ABC News Internet Ventures.

Don\u2019t they know that goes in the recycling?\nWilson is one of those energetic college professors who students will remember for the rest of their lives, thanks to his imagination and creativity. Along with thinking outside the box, he\u2019ll be living in it. Truth is, students retain what their entertaining teachers tell them.\n\u201cNobody wants to hear another lecture about how the world is going to be destroyed if everybody doesn\u2019t drive a Prius,\u201d said Wilson, a seventh-generation Texan who did his postdoctoral work at Harvard University. \u201cWhat we want to do is have a party and have everybody come to the party.\u201d\nThe point of the dumpster experiment is to show that people can live with less. Wilson points out that he will be staying in a space that is a mere 1 percent the size of an average American home.\nSome of Wilson\u2019s students formed a group called Green Is The New Black and won a green-oriented student competition in Dearborn, Mich., that landed Huston-Tillotson a $75,000 grant from the Ford Foundation. Most of the money will be used for scholarships, but $20,000 of it will go to Professor Dumpster\u2019s Dumpster Project, dumpsterproject.org.\nThe dumpster, which Wilson hopes to move into by February, will be cozy. When ready, it will be set up on a concrete slab poured for the project on the Huston-Tillotson campus, at East Seventh and Chicon streets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the same size as this booth, maybe a little bit smaller,\u201d Wilson said, as we ate lunch in a restaurant near downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s six by six.\u201d Forget about stretching out. \u201cI\u2019ll fit in there at an angle,\u201d Wilson added. Actually, the Dumpster Project will use two dumpsters provided by Texas Disposal Systems \u2014 one for Wilson\u2019s living arrangements and one to conduct environmental experiments in Wilson\u2019s Dumpster 101 lab.\n\u201cSomebody said it was a cross between Bill Nye (the Science Guy), Thoreau and Oscar the Grouch,\u201d Wilson said.\nWilson\u2019s students are pumped. \u201cI think he deserves some sort of plaque or something,\u201d said Olivia Sanchez, a Huston-Tillotson senior majoring in biology with a concentration on environmental science.\nWilson\u2019s year in a dumpster will run through various stages.\nDuring the first stage, Wilson will rough it. \u201cDumpster camping,\u201d he calls it. It will be him and four metal walls, and that\u2019s it. Although he will have the dumpster scrubbed for nasties before he climbs in the side door. The dumpster cleaning will provide another teaching opportunity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to show the kids blown-up microscopic images of what was in the dumpster before Professor Dumpster moved into it as a home,\u201d he said.\nHey Doc, what\u2019s for lunch?\n\u201cI want to do an urban forage and not buy anything at H-E-B,\u201d said Professor Dumpster, who plans to do a bit of dumpster diving during the early going.\nAs time goes on, the dumpster will be tricked out with some of the amenities of a middle-class home. Wilson plans to install a solar panel, a little composting toilet, even a shower behind the Dumpster. \u201cAll of the stuff to make it a normal American home instead of a trash can,\u201d Wilson said.\n\u201cI was trying to get a Sleep Number bed,\u201d he added. But when he walked into a mattress store to inquire, he discovered that wouldn\u2019t happen. \u201cThere was a long pause, and they said, \u2018No, we don\u2019t make dumpster home mattresses.\u2019\u201d\nWilson, who will get his water in a bucket from Lady Bird Lake, wants to involve the campus in the project. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get the track team to help me bring up the water from Lady Bird Lake as a track exercise,\u201d he said.\nWilson doesn\u2019t look like a ladies\u2019 man. He\u2019s got nerd written all over him. He wears a bowtie, an old Open Road Stetson like the one LBJ wore, black high-top Converse basketball shoes and thick-framed glasses. Still, he must be a charmer.\nWhen Wilson isn\u2019t dumpstering, he\u2019s visiting foreign countries \u2014 with no luggage. He met his girlfriend, Austin writer Clara Bensen, last year online through the OkCupid website. Then he convinced her to tour Europe with him \u2014 with no bags. Wilson and Bensen visited eight countries in 21 days with little but the clothes on their back.\nIf you can convince a woman to tour Europe without a bringing a bag the size of a circus tent, your persuasive abilities are spectacular.\n\u201cHer friends said, \u2018We don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy for going to Europe with no clothes. We just think you\u2019re crazy for going anywhere with Wilson,\u2019\u201d Wilson said.\nOK, so Bensen brought along one carry-on. \u201cShe took a purse, because she wanted to take two pairs of underwear,\u201d said Wilson, who brought only the underwear he was wearing.\nWilson explained the laundry regimen he recommends when you\u2019re traveling through Hungary, Turkey and Croatia with only a single pair of boxers.\n\u201cOn the first day, you wear your underwear under your jeans. On the second day, you go commando. And the third day, you wash clothes,\u201d he said. Is there a frat rat in America who isn\u2019t familiar with this routine? Except for the wash part.\nBy the way, Wilson doesn\u2019t figure his girlfriend will spend the year with him in his dumpster home.\n\u201cThere are visitation hours on campus, so my girlfriend can\u2019t stay overnight,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll appeal that.\u201d\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nAd\nLearn More\nA woman in her 40s drank \"Ceramide\" and her skin became\u2026\nA woman in her 40s drank \"Ceramide\" and her skin became\u2026\nURUHIME MOMOKO\n|\nAd\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

CNET Road Trip 2014 stopped by to see how the Dumpster Project could lead to healthier cities.\nDaniel Terdiman\nJuly 1, 2014 4:00 a.m. PT\n1 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nProf. Dumpster leaping\nAUSTIN, Texas -- In a world of dwindling resources, the average American lifestyle is almost certainly unsustainable. Yet most people don't have a model for how to live differently.\nThat's what Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, wants to provide. An environmental sciences professor and dean at Huston Tillotson University here, Professor Dumpster is in the middle of a project meant to prove it's possible to live super minimally, and super efficiently.\nFor a year, Professor Dumpster is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster -- outfitted, of course, for civilized living. But the goal is to do that living with zero waste, and extremely minimal use of power and water.\nAs part of Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman came to the Texas capital to see just how comfortable one can be living in a glorified trash can. Turns out, if you're willing to let go of a few creature comforts, it's not too bad.\nPlease click here to read my full story on the Dumpster Project.\n2 of 20\nDumpster Project\nDumpster Project Phase III drawing\nCurrently, the Dumpster Project is in Phase I, and Professor Dumpster and his team are actively trying to raise money to proceed to the next stages of the initiative.\nThis document shows what the project is intended to look like when it's much further along. With multiple stories, and a developed garden, this dumpster could be sophisticated living for the minimalist-inclined.\n3 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nProf. Dumpster laughing\nStanding inside the dumpster, located at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, laughs and enjoys his 33-square-foot home.\n4 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nPushing the water barrel\nIn its current state, the dumpster isn't connected to the grid in any way, which means that Professor Dumpster must get water the old-fashioned way -- by carrying it home. When he needs water, he pushes this water barrel, which holds 24 gallons, to Austin's Lady Bird Lake, an hour round-trip, where he fills it up. When he returns, he filters the water in order to make it potable.\n5 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nOn the phone\nThough the dumpster isn't connected to the grid, that doesn't mean Professor Dumpster is cut off from the world. He uses his iPhone to talk to people, and he spends much of the daylight hours at his university office, which is only a couple hundred yards away.\n6 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nHidden compartments\nAt first glance, you can't tell where Professor Dumpster keeps any of his clothes, bedding, or other important supplies. Then he opens a lid, revealing several hidden compartments under the floor.\n7 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nGarden\nOne element of the Dumpster Project is to grow a sustainable garden alongside the dumpster. Tended by Professor Dumpster and his students, the garden is turning out several kinds of vegetables.\n8 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nBaseline\nAs a way of demonstrating how much less energy and water he can live on than is used by the average American household, Professor Dumpster plans on installing a set of the average collection of household appliances next to the dumpster that he will use for a few months to establish an energy/water/waste consumption baseline. Then he will be able to compare his own usage to that of the baseline.\n9 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nIt's bigger on the inside\nAs an homage to Dr. Who and the Tardis, Professor Dumpster has a welcome mat outside the dumpster that reads \"It's bigger on the inside.\"\n10 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nCouchsurfing note\nProfessor Dumpster has not been the only one to live in the dumpster. Because it is a demonstration project, many others -- including his students -- have spent nights there. But he also opened up the dumpster to users of Couchsurfing.com, prompting this note from the first person to ever use that Web-based service to find a bed in a dumpster.\n11 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nLaying out bed pad\nBecause the dumpster's interior space is so small, Professor Dumpster must keep his bedding hidden away until he needs it.

And On\nHe's leaving the Dumpster to a new, rotating cast of residents\nBY NORA ANKRUM, FRI., FEB. 6, 2015\nprint\nwrite a letter\n\nProfessor Dumpster in his element (Photo by John Anderson)\nHas it really been a year already? Apparently so, says Huston-Tillotson University College Dean Jeff Wilson, who on Tuesday night concluded his year-in-residence in Austin's most esteemed trash can. During the depths of last winter's cold spell, the biology professor moved into a Dumpster on the west side of HT's campus with little more than a sleeping bag and an iPhone for comfort. As an experiment in \"less is more\" living, the Dumpster Project was intended to test the limits of both sustainable design and sanity. In regard to the latter, says Wilson, \"I'm way happier than before I moved into the Dumpster.\"\nIt turns out that a 6-by-6-foot metal box makes an adequate cave for reading, napping, or getting away from it all. At the same time, says Wilson, \"you're just kind of forced to engage more, and I think that's a big part of why I'm happier.\" He notes that the low rent and \"minute-and-a-half\" commute to the office don't hurt either.\n\"We didn't make it to that sort of uber-Dumpster that we wanted,\" says Wilson. \"One of the lessons learned is that it's pretty damn hard to renovate your house when you're living in it.\" A composting toilet, pop-up balcony, and other experimental design elements went unrealized. Still, the project team planted gardens, installed data monitoring equipment, and got an air-conditioning unit (more important than a bathroom, discovered Wilson). Other additions are forthcoming as part of student-driven Brainstorm for the Box design challenges.\nWilson gave the Dumpster a fresh coat of paint last week in anticipation of its next guest, Blackshear Elementary School Principal Betty Jenkins, who planned to stay overnight Wednesday to kick off the Dump\u00adster Project \"Home\" School residency program. Other resident teachers will follow (students\u00ad can nominate a teacher at www.dumpsterproject.org/homeschool). All will return to the classroom with a Dumpster 101 curriculum developed in partnership with EcoRise and Blackshear, and piloted by the roughly 1,000 K-12 students who visited the Dumpster over the last year.\nWilson, meanwhile, is postponing a return to normalcy. Instead, he'll be spending 99 nights in different homes around town (e.g., mansion, high-rise condo, nursing home, under a bridge), all documented and photographed by his partner, writer Clara Benson, and photographer Sarah Natsumi Moore. \"There's such a real housing crisis in Austin,\" says Wilson. \"This doesn't go directly to the heart of that, but it sort of dances around it a bit.\" He hopes to explore the meaning of home and to \"gather a little bit of data\" along the way. \"It would've been a pretty big culture shock to move back into a real house,\" he says. \"I've got to kind of transition.\"\nVisit www.99nightsatx.com to follow Wilson's couch-surfing journey or to nominate a home where he should stay.\nGot something to say on the subject?
